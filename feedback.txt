CRITICAL VALIDATION SUMMARY  

• preview.tsx has already been renamed to preview.ts – confirmed.  
• globals.css is imported first.  
• Background colour utilities (bg-primary / bg-success / bg-warning) are still missing from compiled Storybook assets.  

Root cause now: Tailwind never receives our `tailwind.config.js` during Storybook build. The addon **“@storybook/addon-styling-webpack”** overrides PostCSS processing and ignores external Tailwind config, so only default palette utilities get emitted (blue-500 etc.), not our custom colours.

Fix strategy:  
1. Remove `@storybook/addon-styling-webpack` from the `addons` array in `.storybook/main.ts`.  
2. In `webpackFinal`, inject a straightforward CSS rule:

```
config.module!.rules.push({
  test: /\.css$/,
  use: [
    'style-loader',
    { loader: 'css-loader', options: { importLoaders: 1 } },
    { loader: 'postcss-loader' }          // postcss.config.js already points to Tailwind
  ],
  include: path.resolve(rootDir, '../'),
});
```

3. Re-run `npm run build-storybook` and verify that `storybook-static/` CSS now contains `.bg-primary`, `.bg-success`, `.bg-warning`.

This change re-enables Tailwind’s normal pipeline with our custom theme, restoring colour variants without touching any atom code.
