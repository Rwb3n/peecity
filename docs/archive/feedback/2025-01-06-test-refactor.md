# Test Refactoring Based on Feedback

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Context**: Refactored TieredValidationService tests based on feedback2.txt

## Changes Made

### 1. File Organization ✅
- **Before**: Single 589-line test file
- **After**: 5 modular test files:
  - `config_validation_test.js` - Configuration loading, caching, schema validation
  - `core_validation_test.js` - Core property validation tests
  - `tier_validation_test.js` - High-frequency, optional, specialized tier tests
  - `backward_compatibility_test.js` - v1 API compatibility tests
  - `performance_validation_test.js` - Performance benchmarks (skipped in Red phase)

### 2. Performance Tests Skipped ✅
- Used `describe.skip()` for performance tests during Red phase
- Tests will be enabled in Task 6 when implementation exists
- Added environment-aware thresholds (5ms local, 10ms CI)

### 3. Schema Validation Added ✅
- Added `ajv` validation against `propertyTiers.schema.json`
- Tests verify configuration structure compliance
- Added test for rejecting invalid configurations

### 4. Dynamic Config Path ✅
```javascript
const CONFIG_PATH = process.env.TIER_CONFIG || 
  path.join(__dirname, '../../../src/config/suggestPropertyTiers.json');
```
- Supports environment variable override
- Prepares for issue #0013 (runtime configuration)

### 5. Enhanced Synthetic Property Tests ✅
- Tests verify `synthetic: true` flag
- Tests verify frequency handling for synthetic properties
- Tests ensure synthetic properties excluded from OSM counts

### 6. Improved Test Structure ✅
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better test discoverability
- Easier maintenance and debugging

## Test Summary

**Total Tests**: 40 (35 active + 5 skipped)
- Configuration: 10 tests
- Core Validation: 8 tests  
- Tier Validation: 10 tests
- Backward Compatibility: 7 tests
- Performance: 5 tests (skipped)

All 35 active tests fail with expected error: `TypeError: TieredValidationService is not a constructor`

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller files easier to navigate
2. **CI Clarity**: Test failures show specific area of concern
3. **Future-proof**: Ready for TypeScript migration
4. **Performance**: Skipped tests won't slow Red phase
5. **Flexibility**: Environment variable support for config path
