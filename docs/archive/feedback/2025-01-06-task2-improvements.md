# Task 2 Improvements Based on Feedback

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Context**: Improvements made to Task 2 implementation based on feedback3.txt critique

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ADR Naming Collision
- **Issue**: ADR-001 already existed, created duplicate
- **Fix**: Renamed to ADR-002-property-tiering.md
- **Updated**: All references in documentation

### 2. Property Count Synchronization
- **Issue**: aiconfig.json showed 104 properties instead of 120
- **Fix**: Updated osm_data_integration.property_count to 120
- **Impact**: Prevents future test desynchronization

### 3. Test Brittleness
- **Issue**: Hard-coded tier counts made tests fragile
- **Fix**: Replaced with dynamic validation:
  - Verifies all tiers have properties
  - Ensures core tier is small (â‰¤10)
  - Confirms specialized is largest tier
  - Removes hard-coded counts

### 4. Synthetic Property Handling
- **Issue**: Lat/lng not distinguished from OSM properties
- **Fix**: Added metadata to synthetic properties:
  ```json
  {
    "synthetic": true,
    "description": "Latitude coordinate (not an OSM property)"
  }
  ```

### 5. JSON Schema Validation
- **Issue**: No schema validation for configuration structure
- **Fix**: Created schemas/propertyTiers.schema.json
- **Features**:
  - Validates all required fields
  - Enforces tier enum values
  - Validates validation types
  - Supports synthetic property metadata

## Test Results

All tests pass with improved validation:
- 11 tests passing (reduced from 14 by consolidating tier distribution tests)
- More resilient to tier rebalancing
- Better validation of property metadata

## Benefits

1. **Future-proof**: Tests won't break if tier assignments change
2. **Self-documenting**: Synthetic properties clearly marked
3. **Validation**: JSON schema prevents configuration drift
4. **Consistency**: Property count synchronized across project

These improvements strengthen the foundation for the property tier system implementation.
