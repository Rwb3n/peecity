# Task 4 Corrections Based on Feedback

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Context**: Corrections made to Task 4 issues based on feedback6.txt critique

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Date Correction
- **Issue**: Created_at used 2025-01-06 instead of 2025-07-06
- **Fix**: Updated all three issues to use 2025-07-06T22:00:00Z

### 2. Schema Consistency
- **Issue**: Missing severity field
- **Fix**: Added severity field matching priority:
  - issue_0011: "severity": "HIGH"
  - issue_0012: "severity": "MEDIUM"
  - issue_0013: "severity": "LOW"

### 3. Dependencies Field
- **Issue**: Missing explicit depends_on field
- **Fix**: Added depends_on arrays:
  - issue_0011: []
  - issue_0012: ["0011"]
  - issue_0013: ["0011"]

### 4. Effort Estimation
- **Issue**: Missing estimated_effort field
- **Fix**: Added effort estimates:
  - issue_0011: "M" (Medium - core validation logic)
  - issue_0012: "L" (Large - comprehensive UI work)
  - issue_0013: "L" (Large - complex configuration system)

### 5. Synthetic Properties
- **Issue**: No mention of lat/lng synthetic property handling
- **Fix**: Added requirement in issue_0011:
  "Respect synthetic:true properties (lat/lng) during frequency calculations"

### 6. Granular Acceptance Criteria
- **Issue**: Acceptance criteria too bundled
- **Fix**: Split issue_0011 criteria into specific test cases:
  - Core-tier validation fails with 400 (unit test)
  - High-frequency tier strict validation passes given valid data
  - Optional tier missing property does NOT trigger error
  - Specialized tier invalid type logs warning but still 200
  - All validation unit tests green
  - Performance impact < 5ms per request

### 7. TypeScript File Paths
- **Issue**: JavaScript extensions used instead of TypeScript
- **Fix**: Updated all affected files to use .ts extensions:
  - ValidationService.js → ValidationService.ts
  - suggest.js → suggest/route.ts (Next.js App Router)
  - property-config.js → property-config/route.ts

## Summary

All issues now conform to the project's issue schema with:
- ✅ Correct dates (2025-07-06)
- ✅ Severity field matching priority
- ✅ Explicit depends_on arrays
- ✅ Effort estimates
- ✅ Synthetic property handling
- ✅ Granular acceptance criteria
- ✅ TypeScript file paths

The issues maintain high quality while now being fully consistent with project conventions.
