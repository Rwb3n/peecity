# 📄 **ADR-001: CityPee MVP Architecture Decision Record**

## 🪧 Title:

**Architecture for CityPee: London 24/7 Toilet Map MVP**

## 🗓️ Date:

2025-07-04

## 📝 Status:

✅ *Accepted & Finalized*

## 🎯 Context:

CityPee is a two-night sprint MVP web app for Londoners and visitors to locate public and accessible toilets, with an emphasis on 24-hour and extended-hour availability. The app aims to provide a mobile-friendly, SEO-optimized, community-updated map of verified locations.
Constraints include:

* Limited time and scope: 2 nights to build MVP.
* London-only geographic scope at launch.
* Data initially seeded from public/open datasets or manual entry if needed.
* User submissions logged without moderation at MVP.
* Monetization via ads is optional at MVP stage.

## 🧩 Decision:

We will architect CityPee MVP with the following structure:

### 1️⃣ **Data Sources:**

* Initial dataset: Scrape or manually research London public toilet data (TfL, borough councils, OSM).
* Format: Normalized `toilets.geojson` (or DB table) containing:

  ```
  id, name, lat, lng, hours, accessible, fee, source, last_verified_at, verified_by
  ```

### 2️⃣ **Persistent Store:**

* MVP allows either:

  * Flat file (`toilets.geojson`) served statically, OR
  * Lightweight DB (Postgres/MySQL) for queries if needed.
* User submissions logged separately to `suggestions.log`:

  ```
  id, lat, lng, name, hours, notes, submitted_at, contact_email
  ```

### 3️⃣ **Serving Layer:**

* API endpoints:

  * `GET /toilets?bbox=` — fetch toilets within viewport.
  * `GET /toilets/:id` — detailed page for SEO and details.
  * `POST /toilets/suggest` — log user-contributed corrections or new toilets.

### 4️⃣ **Frontend:**

* Mobile-first, minimal single-page web app.
* Displays a map (Leaflet.js or equivalent) with color-coded markers.
* Search and CTA to add a toilet suggestion.
* Static SEO-optimized pages for boroughs and common queries.

### 5️⃣ **User Contributions:**

* Submissions logged as unmoderated entries, to be reviewed manually later.
* Optional contact email field — no user authentication at MVP.

### 6️⃣ **Monetization:**

* Optional: Embed Google AdSense snippet in frontend to display ads.
* Cookie/consent notice added if ads enabled.

### 7️⃣ **Non-Functional:**

* SEO crawlable static routes.
* Mobile page load under 1.5s.
* No real-time updates; reviewed data can be updated weekly.

## ⚖️ Consequences:

✅ Extremely simple MVP deliverable in 2 nights.
✅ No geo-query complexity beyond bounding-box filtering.
✅ Low maintenance for first launch.
🚫 Data quality at risk if open datasets are incomplete — requires mitigation post-launch.
🚫 Ads introduce cookie/GDPR obligations, minor UX hit.

# 📄 **ADR-001 Addendum: Paid Featured Listings (Future)**

## 🧭 Context Update:

While the initial MVP of CityPee is not a SaaS product, a monetization pathway has been identified: allowing businesses (e.g., cafés, shops, coworking spaces) to **pay for featured placement** on the map.

This is aligned with:

* High-footfall businesses seeking exposure.
* Places with customer toilets that want to attract passerby traffic.
* Hyperlocal targeting (high EV per location).

---

## 💰 Feature Description:

### **Paid Featured Listings (Post-MVP)**

* Businesses can apply to be listed on the CityPee map as a toilet-accessible location.
* They pay a **monthly or annual fee** to be shown with priority styling:

  * Special icon, tooltip ("Toilet available — no purchase required"), brand colors/logo.
  * Filter toggle: "Show cafés/venues with toilets."
* Listings must meet criteria: e.g., public access to toilets, minimum opening hours.

## ⚙️ Architecture Implications:

| Component  | Change Required                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DB schema  | Add `is_featured`, `business_id`, `subscription_status`, `paid_until`, etc. |
| Admin UI   | Dashboard to approve, reject, and manage paid listings.                     |
| Payment    | Stripe integration or equivalent for recurring billing.                     |
| Moderation | Manual verification to prevent abuse.                                       |
| SEO        | Featured listing pages become content hubs with backlinks.                  |

## 🧠 Consequences:

✅ Adds direct monetization channel.
✅ Opens optional SaaS evolution pathway.
🚧 Requires moderation, anti-abuse, payment logic, and customer support.
🚧 Changes the tone of the site from pure utility to a semi-commercial model — should be clearly disclosed.

## 🛣️ Recommended Timeline:

Phase 2 or 3 — only after:

* 1,000+ monthly users
* 5+ venues express interest organically
* Submission/review pipeline for businesses is stabilized
