**Parent Plan Task**: `create_suggestion_modal_tests` from plan_frontend_organisms_implementation_0068.txt

**Testing Tools**: Jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, jsdom environment, nock (for API mocking)

## üéØ Objective

Create comprehensive test suite for SuggestionModal organism component following TDD Red phase methodology. Tests must cover modal rendering, ContributionForm integration, location passing, API submission, success/error states, modal behaviors (ESC, backdrop, focus trap), and map integration while establishing baseline failures for subsequent Green phase implementation.

## üìù Context

This is the Red phase test creation for SuggestionModal organism. Modal serves as the interface for toilet suggestion submissions, wrapping ContributionForm molecule with proper modal behaviors. Component must integrate with MapView for location data, handle v2 API submissions, and provide full accessibility compliance. This follows successful FloatingActionButton completion (100% test pass rate) and leverages established testing patterns from organisms and molecules.

## ü™ú Task Steps Summary

1. Create SuggestionModal_test.tsx with comprehensive test structure
2. Test modal rendering and Dialog component integration
3. Test ContributionForm integration and proper form rendering
4. Test location data passing (from map center or user selection)
5. Test form submission with v2 API integration (success/error handling)
6. Test modal behaviors (ESC key, backdrop click, focus trap)
7. Test accessibility features (focus management, ARIA labels)
8. Test loading and success/error state displays
9. Test modal animations and enter/exit transitions
10. Test integration patterns with MapView organism
11. Verify all tests fail initially (Red phase requirement)

## üß† Knowledge Capture

**SuggestionModal Requirements from Plan:**
- Foundation: shadcn/ui Dialog components for modal structure
- Content: ContributionForm molecule rendered inside Dialog
- Location Integration: Get current location from map center or user selection
- API Integration: Handle form submission with v2 API endpoints
- State Management: Show loading/success/error states during submission
- Modal Behaviors: ESC key, backdrop click, focus trap when open
- Accessibility: Return focus on close, proper ARIA attributes
- Animations: Smooth enter/exit transitions

**Component Architecture:**
- Uses shadcn/ui Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle components
- Wraps ContributionForm molecule with location pre-population
- Integrates with v2 suggest API endpoint for submissions
- Manages modal state and communicates with parent components
- Follows organism-level patterns from MapView and FloatingActionButton

**Testing Patterns:**
- Mock Dialog components from shadcn/ui for reliable testing
- Mock API calls using nock for form submission testing
- Test form integration using established ContributionForm patterns
- Mock location data passing from parent components
- Test keyboard and mouse modal interactions
- Test focus management and accessibility features

## üõ† Actions Taken

- Created comprehensive SuggestionModal_test.tsx with 9 test categories and 40+ test cases
- Implemented modal rendering tests (Dialog structure, open/close states, ARIA attributes)
- Added ContributionForm integration tests (rendering, location pre-population, state passing)
- Created location data passing tests (specific location, map center fallback, priority handling)
- Implemented API integration tests (v2 suggest endpoint, success/error handling, network errors)
- Added success & error state tests (message display, retry capability, modal closing)
- Created modal behavior tests (backdrop click, ESC key, cancel button, submission prevention)
- Implemented accessibility tests (focus trap, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus return)
- Added animation & transition tests (enter/exit animations, fade transitions)
- Created MapView integration tests (location data flow, parent updates, fallback handling)
- Implemented props validation tests (className, required props, testId support)
- Mocked shadcn/ui Dialog components for reliable testing
- Mocked ContributionForm for isolated organism testing
- Used nock for v2 API endpoint testing with various response scenarios
- Verified Red phase completion - all tests fail as expected (component doesn't exist)
