## 🎯 Objective

Implement MapView integration fixes including proper marker icon application, MarkerPopup props integration, event handling improvements, and selective mocking strategy for stable testing

## 📝 Context

Following successful completion of mapview_integration_test_create (VALIDATION_PASSED with RED phase), this IMPLEMENTATION task focuses on fixing the critical integration issues exposed by the failing tests. The comprehensive test suite revealed "Element type is invalid" errors and 12 failing integration tests:

- ✅ **Integration Issues Exposed**: All 12 tests fail as expected, proving critical MapView problems exist
- ✅ **Test Data Management Ready**: Validated factories and scenarios support realistic integration testing
- ✅ **Enhanced Test Environment Operational**: Canvas support, performance monitoring, React-Leaflet utilities available
- ❌ **5 Critical Issues Identified**: Broken marker icons, missing popup buttons, event bubbling, height inheritance, test brittleness

**Implementation Strategy**: Fix the actual MapView component integration issues to make the failing tests pass while maintaining realistic component behavior.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Fix "Element type is invalid" error in MapView component rendering
2. Implement proper marker icon application with defaultIcon prop
3. Add MarkerPopup props integration (onDirections, onReport, onShare)
4. Fix popup event handling to prevent premature closing
5. Resolve map height inheritance and CSS conflicts
6. Implement selective mocking strategy for stable testing
7. Ensure all 12 integration tests pass (GREEN phase)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Critical Issues to Fix (from failing tests)**:
1. **"Element type is invalid" Error**: MapView component has React-Leaflet integration problems
2. **Broken Marker Icons**: External URL dependencies need defaultIcon application
3. **Missing MarkerPopup Buttons**: Callback props (onDirections, onReport, onShare) not passed through
4. **Popup Premature Closing**: Event bubbling causes popups to disappear when clicked inside
5. **Map Height Inheritance**: CSS conflicts prevent proper height calculation
6. **Test Brittleness**: Over-mocking hides real integration issues

**Enhanced Test Infrastructure Available**:
- ✅ **Minimal Mocking Strategy**: Enhanced React-Leaflet utilities for realistic testing
- ✅ **Test Data Factories**: Validated toilet feature generation and scenario management
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Integration with performance utilities for optimization
- ✅ **Canvas Support**: Map rendering simulation in JSDOM environment
- ✅ **Failing Test Suite**: 12 comprehensive tests exposing all critical integration issues

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Component-Level Fixes**: Address MapView component integration issues directly
- **Props Integration**: Ensure all required props are passed through component hierarchy
- **Event Handling**: Implement proper event propagation and bubbling prevention
- **CSS Resolution**: Fix height inheritance and responsive behavior
- **Selective Mocking**: Balance realistic testing with test stability

## 🛠 Actions Taken

**Pre-Flight Analysis Completed**:
- Reviewed failing test results from mapview_integration_test_create task
- Analyzed "Element type is invalid" error indicating React-Leaflet integration problems
- Identified specific integration fixes needed for each of the 12 failing tests
- Assessed MapView component structure for prop passing and event handling issues
- Planned implementation strategy to address component integration while maintaining test stability
- Designed approach for selective mocking to balance realism with reliability
