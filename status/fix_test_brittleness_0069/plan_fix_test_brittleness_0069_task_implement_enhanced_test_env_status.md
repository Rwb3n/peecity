**Parent Plan Task**: `implement_enhanced_test_env` from plan_fix_test_brittleness_0069.txt

**Testing Tools**: Jest, @testing-library/react, canvas, react-leaflet, leaflet

**Cookbook Patterns**: docs/cookbook/recipe_robust_react_testing.md

## 🎯 Objective

Implement enhanced Jest configuration for React-Leaflet compatibility, including JSDOM setup with canvas support, map rendering utilities, and real toilets.geojson data import for testing

## 📝 Context

**Dependency**: Enhanced test environment setup task (RED phase) created failing tests that exposed all environment gaps requiring implementation

**Implementation Goal**: Transform brittle, over-mocked MapView tests into reliable integration tests by implementing:
- Canvas support for map rendering in JSDOM environment
- Real React-Leaflet integration with selective mocking strategy
- Authentic toilets.geojson data import infrastructure
- Animation framework testing capabilities
- Performance optimization for large dataset testing

This implementation enables the GREEN phase where enhanced tests pass by providing realistic test environment that balances real behavior with test reliability.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Implement comprehensive canvas support with HTMLCanvasElement and CanvasRenderingContext2D mocking
2. Create enhanced React-Leaflet mocks with realistic component behavior simulation
3. Configure Jest module mapping for real toilets.geojson data imports
4. Implement animation framework support with enhanced getComputedStyle
5. Add performance infrastructure for large dataset testing
6. Update Jest configuration with enhanced setup files and transform patterns
7. Transform enhanced test file to use new infrastructure and validate GREEN phase
8. Verify all enhanced tests now pass with realistic integration testing
