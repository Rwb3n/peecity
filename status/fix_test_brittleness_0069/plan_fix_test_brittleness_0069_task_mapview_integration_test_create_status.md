## 🎯 Objective

Create failing test for MapView integration testing - test should expect real React-Leaflet components to render with minimal mocking, marker icons to display correctly, and popup interactions to work without premature closing

## 📝 Context

Following successful completion of test data management infrastructure validation (VALIDATION_PASSED), this TEST_CREATION task focuses on the critical MapView integration issues identified in the original investigation. The enhanced infrastructure is now ready to support realistic integration testing:

- ✅ **Enhanced test environment operational**: Canvas support, React-Leaflet utilities, performance monitoring
- ✅ **Test data management validated**: Comprehensive factories, scenarios, and validators proven functional
- ✅ **5 Critical Issues Identified**: Broken marker icons, missing popup buttons, popup closing, height inheritance, test brittleness

**Next Phase**: Create failing tests that expose the real MapView integration problems using minimal mocking to validate actual component behavior.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create failing test for real React-Leaflet component rendering with minimal mocking
2. Test marker icon display and customization (expect broken images)
3. Validate popup interaction workflows without premature closing
4. Verify MarkerPopup button rendering with proper props (expect missing buttons)
5. Test event handling and bubbling prevention
6. Validate map height inheritance and CSS issues
7. Ensure tests fail due to existing integration issues (RED phase)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Critical Integration Issues to Test**:
1. **Broken Marker Icons**: External URL dependency causes broken marker display
2. **Missing MarkerPopup Buttons**: Props not passed correctly (onDirections, onReport, onShare)
3. **Popup Premature Closing**: Event bubbling causes popup to disappear on click
4. **Map Height Inheritance**: CSS conflicts prevent proper height calculation
5. **Test Brittleness**: Over-mocked components hide real integration problems

**Enhanced Test Environment Capabilities**:
- ✅ **Selective React-Leaflet Mocking**: Real component behavior with stability mocking where needed
- ✅ **Canvas Support**: Map rendering simulation in JSDOM environment
- ✅ **Test Data Factories**: Realistic toilet features with London coordinates
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Integration with performance utilities for test optimization
- ✅ **Mock Callback System**: Complete MapView callback coverage

**Integration Testing Strategy**:
- **Minimal Mocking**: Use real React-Leaflet components where possible, mock only external dependencies
- **Real Data Integration**: Use validated test data factories for authentic testing scenarios
- **Event Handling Focus**: Test actual user interaction workflows and event propagation
- **Performance Awareness**: Leverage performance monitoring for test optimization

## 📊 Pre-Flight Integration Issues Analysis

**✅ CRITICAL INTEGRATION ISSUES DOCUMENTED**:

**Issue 1: Broken Marker Icons**:
- ✅ **Problem**: External URL dependency causes marker icons to display as broken images
- ✅ **Test Strategy**: Render markers and validate icon src attributes and image display
- ✅ **Expected Failure**: Icons show as broken images or missing due to external URL loading
- ✅ **Validation**: Check for proper icon application and custom icon usage

**Issue 2: Missing MarkerPopup Buttons**:
- ✅ **Problem**: Required props (onDirections, onReport, onShare) not passed to MarkerPopup
- ✅ **Test Strategy**: Click markers to open popups and validate button presence
- ✅ **Expected Failure**: Popup buttons missing or non-functional due to missing props
- ✅ **Validation**: Verify callback props are properly passed through to popup components

**Issue 3: Popup Premature Closing**:
- ✅ **Problem**: Event bubbling causes popups to disappear when clicked inside
- ✅ **Test Strategy**: Open popup and click inside popup area to test event handling
- ✅ **Expected Failure**: Popup disappears due to event bubbling instead of staying open
- ✅ **Validation**: Test event propagation and stopPropagation implementation

**Issue 4: Map Height Inheritance Problems**:
- ✅ **Problem**: CSS conflicts prevent proper map height calculation and inheritance
- ✅ **Test Strategy**: Render map in different container contexts and validate computed height
- ✅ **Expected Failure**: Map height calculation fails or inherits incorrect values
- ✅ **Validation**: Test responsive height behavior and CSS cascade resolution

**Issue 5: Test Brittleness**:
- ✅ **Problem**: Over-mocked components hide real integration issues
- ✅ **Test Strategy**: Use minimal mocking to expose real React-Leaflet component behavior
- ✅ **Expected Failure**: Tests reveal hidden integration problems when using real components
- ✅ **Validation**: Compare behavior with enhanced vs. over-mocked test environments

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**✅ INTEGRATION TEST STRATEGY Impact Assessment**: 
- ✅ **Critical issues well-documented**: All 5 integration problems clearly identified with test strategies
- ✅ **Enhanced environment ready**: Canvas support, performance monitoring, test data validated
- ✅ **Minimal mocking approach planned**: Balance between realism and test stability established
- ✅ **RED phase strategy clear**: Failing tests will expose existing integration problems

**RED Phase Test Creation Strategy**:
- ✅ **Real component rendering**: Use enhanced React-Leaflet utilities with minimal mocking
- ✅ **Authentic data integration**: Leverage validated test data factories for realistic scenarios
- ✅ **Event handling validation**: Test actual user interaction workflows and event propagation
- ✅ **Performance awareness**: Use performance monitoring for test optimization

**Expected RED Phase Outcomes**: 
1. **Marker icon failures**: Broken images due to external URL dependencies
2. **Missing popup buttons**: Callback props not passed through to MarkerPopup components
3. **Popup interaction failures**: Event bubbling causes premature popup closing
4. **Height calculation issues**: CSS inheritance problems in different container contexts
