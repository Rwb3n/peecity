## 🎯 Objective

Create failing test for enhanced React-Leaflet testing environment setup - test should expect MapContainer to render with real DOM elements, verify canvas support for map rendering, and validate toilets.geojson data import functionality

## 📝 Context

**Blocked Task**: Storybook stories implementation in plan 0068 is blocked due to critical test brittleness in MapView component (5 critical issues identified)

**Root Problem**: Over-mocked MapView tests provide false confidence and hide real integration issues:
- Broken marker icons (external URL dependency)
- Missing MarkerPopup buttons (props not passed)  
- Popup disappearing on click (event handling issues)
- Map height inheritance problems (CSS conflicts)
- Test brittleness (React-Leaflet components fully mocked)

This task establishes enhanced test environment that can detect real React-Leaflet integration issues, unblocking reliable Storybook implementation.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create failing test for MapContainer rendering with real React-Leaflet components
2. Test canvas support for map rendering in JSDOM environment
3. Validate toilets.geojson data import and structure compatibility
4. Verify test fails due to missing enhanced environment setup
5. Document specific failure modes and requirements for implementation phase

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Current Jest Configuration Analysis**:
- ✅ JSDOM environment configured with next/jest integration
- ✅ TypeScript support with ts-jest and ESM modules
- ❌ Canvas support for map rendering: NOT CONFIGURED
- ❌ React-Leaflet compatibility: NOT ENHANCED (components fully mocked)
- ❌ Real data integration: MINIMAL (hardcoded test fixtures only)

**Test Environment Gaps Identified**:
1. **Canvas Mock Missing**: No canvas support for Leaflet map rendering in JSDOM
2. **React-Leaflet Mocks Too Aggressive**: Components completely replaced with divs
3. **Real Data Integration**: toilets.geojson not imported in test environment
4. **Animation Framework**: No animation testing support for Material Design compliance
5. **Event Handling**: Shallow event mocking doesn't catch bubbling issues

## 🛠 Actions Taken

**Pre-Flight Analysis Completed**:
- Analyzed plan_fix_test_brittleness_0069.txt comprehensive requirements
- Reviewed blocked Storybook task critical issues (5 major problems identified)
- Examined current Jest configuration in jest.config.js
- Analyzed existing MapView test over-mocking patterns (lines 12-39 in MapView_test.tsx)
- Verified real toilets.geojson data availability (473KB, 1,044 features)
- Assessed external dependencies and version compatibility

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: ✅ Yes - No dependencies for this initial TEST_CREATION task
**External Dependencies Available**: 
- ✅ `jest@29.0.0` and `jest-environment-jsdom@29.0.0`: Available and configured
- ✅ `react-leaflet@4.2.1` and `leaflet@1.9.4`: Available but heavily mocked
- ✅ `@testing-library/react@14.0.0`: Available for component testing
- ❌ `canvas`: NOT in dependencies (required for map rendering)
- ✅ `data/toilets.geojson`: Confirmed present (473KB, 1,044 features)

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: Medium (from plan_fix_test_brittleness_0069.txt)
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: ✅ **MATCHES EXPECTATIONS** - React-Leaflet testing complexity confirmed as predicted. Canvas mocking and DOM setup identified as key challenges requiring specific environment configuration.

## ✅ Pre-Flight Validation

**Result:** ✅ **PRE_FLIGHT_COMPLETE** - Enhanced test environment setup task ready for execution
**Assumptions Check:** ✅ **CONFIRMED** - React-Leaflet testing complexity matches plan predictions. Canvas mocking and DOM setup challenges validated.
**Details:** Current test configuration identified as inadequate for React-Leaflet integration testing. Over-mocking prevents detection of 5 critical MapView issues. Enhanced environment required for reliable component testing.

## 🔗 Pre-Flight Summary

**Environment Assessment**: 
- **Current State**: JSDOM + aggressive mocking provides false test confidence
- **Required Enhancement**: Canvas support + real React-Leaflet integration + authentic data
- **Success Criteria**: Test fails initially, exposing need for enhanced environment
- **Implementation Ready**: Clear path to reliable component testing identified

**Risk Assessment**: 
- **Low Risk**: Data import and Jest configuration are well-understood
- **Medium Risk**: Canvas mocking and React-Leaflet compatibility may require iteration  
- **Mitigation**: Incremental approach with fallback to selective mocking if needed

## 🏁 Pre-Flight Status

**Status**: ✅ **PRE_FLIGHT_VALIDATED** - Ready for enhanced test environment setup execution
**Task Readiness**: All dependencies analyzed, environment gaps identified, execution strategy defined

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**Immediate Impact**: 
- Enhanced test environment will expose real React-Leaflet integration issues
- Reliable testing will unblock Storybook implementation  
- Test brittleness elimination enables confident component development

**Next Phase**: Execute enhanced_test_env_setup task (TEST_CREATION phase - Red)
- Create failing test that requires canvas support and real React-Leaflet integration
- Validate toilets.geojson import functionality
- Document specific failure modes for implementation phase
