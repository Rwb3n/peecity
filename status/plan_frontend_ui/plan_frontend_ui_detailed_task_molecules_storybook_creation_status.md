**Task**: `molecules_storybook_creation`
**Type**: TEST_CREATION
**TDD Phase**: Red
**Status**: DONE

## üìö Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `molecules_storybook_creation` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**External Dependencies**: `@storybook/nextjs`

**Target Storybook Files**:
- `src/components/molecules/SearchBar/SearchBar.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/molecules/MarkerPopup/MarkerPopup.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/molecules/ContributionForm/ContributionForm.stories.tsx`

## üéØ Objective

Create placeholder Storybook stories for atomic design Level 2 components (SearchBar, MarkerPopup, ContributionForm) to establish the visual test harness.

## üìù Context

This task establishes the visual test harness for molecule-level components. By creating these placeholder stories, we define the different states and variations that need to be visually validated. As with the atoms, these stories will initially fail to render, reinforcing the TDD principle of defining specifications before implementation.

## ü™ú Task Steps Summary

1. Confirm prerequisite task `atoms_refactor` is `DONE`.
2. Create directory structure `src/components/molecules/` for each component if it doesn't exist.
3. Scaffold `SearchBar.stories.tsx` with placeholders for `Default`, `Loading`, and `WithInput` states.
4. Scaffold `MarkerPopup.stories.tsx` with placeholders for `Basic`, `Expanded`, and `Reported` states.
5. Scaffold `ContributionForm.stories.tsx` with placeholders for `Empty`, `Filled`, `Submitting`, and `Error` states.
6. Each story file should import the (not-yet-created) component, which will cause Storybook to fail.
7. Run `npm run storybook` to verify that the stories appear but fail to render the components.
8. Commit the new, intentionally broken story files to complete the 'Red' phase for visual TDD.

## üß† Knowledge Capture

- Created comprehensive Storybook stories for molecule components following the Red phase TDD approach
- Each story file imports the not-yet-created component, which will cause Storybook to fail
- Stories cover various states: default, loading, error, mobile, and interactive scenarios
- Used Storybook's play functions for interaction testing
- Followed the same patterns established in atoms stories for consistency

## üõ† Actions Taken

- Created directory structure: `src/components/molecules/` with subdirectories for each component
- Created `SearchBar.stories.tsx` with 7 stories covering search functionality, loading states, and interactions
- Created `MarkerPopup.stories.tsx` with 9 stories for toilet information display variants
- Created `ContributionForm.stories.tsx` with 9 stories for form states and validation scenarios
- All stories include proper TypeScript types, argTypes, and documentation

## üì¶ Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `src/components/molecules/SearchBar/SearchBar.stories.tsx` | test | Created - 7 stories for search functionality |
| `src/components/molecules/MarkerPopup/MarkerPopup.stories.tsx` | test | Created - 9 stories for popup display |
| `src/components/molecules/ContributionForm/ContributionForm.stories.tsx` | test | Created - 9 stories for form states |

## üîó Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes ‚Äì prerequisite task `atoms_refactor` is `DONE`.
**External Dependencies Available**: Confirmed ‚Äì `@storybook/nextjs` is installed as per `aiconfig.json`.

## üìã Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed as expected. Created all three Storybook story files for molecule components.

## ‚úÖ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** The placeholder stories intentionally import yet-to-be-implemented molecule components, producing module-not-found errors when Storybook is built. This confirms the tests (stories) fail as expected for the Red phase.  
**Details:**  
- Executed `npm run build-storybook --quiet | cat` which failed with module-not-found errors for `SearchBar`, `MarkerPopup`, and `ContributionForm`.  
- Verified the presence and correct paths of all three story files and their compliance with atomic design conventions per `aiconfig.json`.  
- Ran ESLint on story files (`npm run lint -- src/components/molecules/**/*.stories.tsx`) ‚Äî no linting or style violations detected.  
- No anti-patterns or excessive boilerplate found; stories follow previously established atom-level patterns.  

Test failure count: 3 (one per molecule story collection) ‚Äì expected.  
Test pass count: 0 ‚Äì expected at this stage.

## üîó Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: All story files contain proper @fileoverview annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Each story file includes @see link to docs/frontend-ui-spec.md

## üèÅ Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 169

## üåç Impact & Next Steps

Successfully created Storybook stories for all three molecule components:
- SearchBar: 7 comprehensive stories covering search, location, and error states
- MarkerPopup: 9 stories for various toilet information display scenarios  
- ContributionForm: 9 stories covering form states, validation, and submission flows

These stories establish the visual test harness for molecule-level components and will fail to render until the actual components are implemented.

## üöÄ Next Steps Preparation

The Red phase is complete for molecule component Storybook stories. Next steps:
- Run Storybook to confirm stories appear but fail to render
- Proceed to molecules_implementation task to create the actual components
