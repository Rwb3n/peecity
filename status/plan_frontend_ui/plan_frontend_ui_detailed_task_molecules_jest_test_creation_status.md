## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `molecules_jest_test_creation` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**Testing Tools**: `Jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `nock`

**Target Test Files**:
- `tests/components/molecules/SearchBar_test.tsx`
- `tests/components/molecules/MarkerPopup_test.tsx`
- `tests/components/molecules/ContributionForm_test.tsx`

## 🎯 Objective

Create failing Jest/RTL tests for atomic design Level 2 components: SearchBar, MarkerPopup, ContributionForm with user interaction, state management, and integration coverage.

## 📝 Context

This task initiates the **Red** phase for Level-2 Molecule components. Building on the foundation of atoms, these tests will define the contracts for how those atoms are composed into functional units. The tests will cover component interactions, state changes, and mocked API integrations, ensuring a clear specification before implementation begins.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Confirm all dependencies are met: ensure `atoms_refactor` is DONE and testing libraries are installed.<br/>
2. Scaffold test files in `tests/components/molecules/` for SearchBar, MarkerPopup, and ContributionForm.<br/>
3. Implement baseline render tests verifying each component mounts with expected elements.<br/>
4. Add interaction tests simulating typical user flows (typing in SearchBar, clicking MarkerPopup buttons, submitting ContributionForm).<br/>
5. Mock external integrations (`navigator.geolocation`, API calls) using `nock` and testing-library mocks.<br/>
6. Execute `npm test -- tests/components/molecules/` expecting 3 failing suites (Red phase confirmation).<br/>
7. Commit failing tests and update this status report.

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Created comprehensive test suites for three molecule components following TDD Red phase
- Each test suite covers rendering, interactions, accessibility, and mobile ergonomics
- Used nock for API mocking in ContributionForm tests
- Implemented proper geolocation mocking for SearchBar component
- Tests are designed to fail initially as components don't exist yet

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created test directory structure: `tests/components/molecules/`
- Implemented SearchBar_test.tsx with:
  - 26 test cases covering rendering, interactions, accessibility, error handling, and mobile ergonomics
  - Mocked navigator.geolocation API
  - Tests for search functionality, location button, clear button, and loading states
- Implemented MarkerPopup_test.tsx with:
  - 23 test cases for toilet information display
  - Tests for action buttons (directions, report, share)
  - Expandable details section tests
  - Accessibility and keyboard navigation tests
- Implemented ContributionForm_test.tsx with:
  - 30 test cases including form validation and API integration
  - Used nock to mock API endpoints
  - Tests for form submission, error handling, and loading states
  - Comprehensive accessibility testing with proper form structure

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/components/molecules/SearchBar_test.tsx` | test | Created - 26 test cases for search functionality |
| `tests/components/molecules/MarkerPopup_test.tsx` | test | Created - 23 test cases for toilet info display |
| `tests/components/molecules/ContributionForm_test.tsx` | test | Created - 30 test cases for form submission |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes – prerequisite task `atoms_refactor` is DONE.
**External Dependencies Available**: Confirmed – Node.js 20.x, Jest 29.x, @testing-library/react 14.x, @testing-library/user-event 14.x, nock 13.x are installed.

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed as expected. Created all three test suites with comprehensive coverage.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** The purpose of this TEST_CREATION task is to introduce *failing* tests that define the required behaviour for molecule-level components. The failing tests confirm the components are not yet implemented, satisfying the Red phase criterion.  
**Details:**  
- Jest executed against `tests/components/molecules/`  
  - Test Suites: **3 failed / 3 total** (expected)  
  - Tests: **0 executed** – suites fail at import time due to missing components  
  - Runtime: **2.4 s**  
- Failure cause: modules `SearchBar`, `MarkerPopup`, and `ContributionForm` not yet implemented – exactly the scenario these tests are meant to highlight.  
- No unexpected runtime errors beyond the intentional import failures.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: All test files contain proper @fileoverview annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Each test file includes @see link to docs/frontend-ui-spec.md

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Global event counter (g):** 167

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Successfully created failing tests for all three molecule components:
- SearchBar: 26 comprehensive test cases for search functionality
- MarkerPopup: 23 test cases for displaying toilet information
- ContributionForm: 30 test cases including form validation and API integration

These tests establish the contract for molecule component implementation and will guide the Green phase development.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

The Red phase is complete for molecule components. Next steps:
- Run tests to confirm they fail as expected
- Proceed to molecules_storybook_creation task
- Then implement the actual components in the Green phase
