**Parent Plan Task**: `setup_environment` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**External Dependencies**:
- `@storybook/addon-a11y@^8.1.0`
- `@tanstack/react-query@^4.36.1`
- `zustand@^4.4.7`
- `react-leaflet-markercluster@^3.0.0`

## 🎯 Objective

Verify existing environment and install missing dependencies for the frontend UI epic.

## 📝 Context

This task serves as the initial setup for the comprehensive frontend UI epic. It ensures that all necessary dependencies for Storybook, state management, and mapping are installed, and that the development environment is correctly configured before any new tests or code are written. It validates that key documentation and architectural patterns are in place.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Verify existing environment and package.json dependencies
2. Install missing frontend dependencies for state management and mapping
3. Correct version conflicts for unavailable packages
4. Verify cookbook documentation exists
5. Update status report with completion details

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- `react-leaflet-markercluster@^3.0.0` does not exist in npm registry; latest stable is v4.2.1
- All required cookbook documentation exists and is properly structured
- Environment is now fully configured for atomic design component development

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Installed `@storybook/addon-a11y@^8.1.0` for accessibility testing in Storybook
- Installed `@tanstack/react-query@^4.36.1` for server state management
- Installed `zustand@^4.4.7` for lightweight client state management
- Corrected and installed `react-leaflet-markercluster@^4.2.1` (updated from unavailable v3.0.0)
- Verified existence of all required cookbook documentation files
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json with new dependencies

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `package.json` | config | Updated with new dependencies |
| `package-lock.json` | config | Updated with dependency resolution |
| `status/plan_frontend_ui_detailed_task_setup_environment_status.md` | doc | completed |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Initial setup task with no prerequisites
**External Dependencies Available**: 
- `@storybook/addon-a11y@^8.1.0`: **INSTALLED** ✓
- `@tanstack/react-query@^4.36.1`: **INSTALLED** ✓
- `zustand@^4.4.7`: **INSTALLED** ✓
- `react-leaflet-markercluster@^4.2.1`: **INSTALLED** ✓ (corrected from v3.0.0)

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed successfully with one minor version correction. All dependencies installed and environment ready for frontend development.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All assumptions valid - cookbook documentation exists, dependencies available (with version correction)
**Details:** Environment successfully configured with all required dependencies for state management, mapping, and accessibility testing

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A - Configuration files do not require artifact annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: N/A - Setup task, no implementation artifacts created

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 156

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Environment is fully configured for frontend UI development. The project now has all necessary dependencies for:
- State management (@tanstack/react-query, zustand)
- Mapping with clustering (react-leaflet-markercluster)
- Accessibility testing (@storybook/addon-a11y)

Ready to proceed with component development following atomic design principles.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

Environment setup complete. Next task should focus on:
- Storybook configuration and setup
- Initial atomic component development
- Testing infrastructure for components

All required dependencies are now available for frontend UI epic progression.
