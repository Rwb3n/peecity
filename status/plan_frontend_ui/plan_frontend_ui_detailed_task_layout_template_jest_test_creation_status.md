## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `layout_template_jest_test_creation` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**Testing Tools**: `Jest`, `@testing-library/react`

**Target Test Files**:
- `tests/components/templates/HomeLayout_test.tsx`

## 🎯 Objective

Create failing Jest/RTL tests for HomeLayout template: responsive layout, component composition, mobile navigation, and overall user flow integration.

## 📝 Context

This task initiates the **Red** phase for the HomeLayout template. Templates are responsible for composing organisms and molecules into a page structure. These tests will define the contract for how the MapView and other UI elements are laid out, ensuring the overall page structure is sound before the final page implementation.
