## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`, `docs/cookbook/recipe_dependency_injection_hooks.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `molecules_refactor` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**Testing Tools**: <!-- Jest, @testing-library/react, nock, supertest, jsdom, sinon, nodemailer-mock, shelljs -->

**Cookbook Patterns**: <!-- docs/cookbook/recipe_*.md if applicable -->

## 🎯 Objective

Optimize molecule components for mobile performance, improve error handling, enhance accessibility, and add comprehensive interaction testing.

## 📝 Context

This is the **Refactor** phase for molecules. With working molecule components, the focus is now on improving their internal structure and performance. This includes implementing patterns like dependency injection for hooks (to improve testability), adding robust error boundaries, and optimizing interaction logic (e.g., debouncing) without altering the component's external API.
