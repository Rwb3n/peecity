## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `home_page_test_creation` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**Testing Tools**: `Jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `next`, `@tanstack/react-query`

**Target Test Files**:
- `tests/pages/home_page_test.tsx`
- `tests/integration/toilet_discovery_flow_test.tsx`

## 🎯 Objective

Create failing tests for home page: Next.js App Router integration, full user flow testing, state management, and end-to-end toilet discovery workflow.

## 📝 Context

This task brings everything together. The tests created here will validate the final page as the user will experience it. They will cover the integration of the HomeLayout template into the Next.js App Router, the initialization of state management providers, and the end-to-end user flow of finding a toilet. These tests are the final contract for the application's core functionality.
