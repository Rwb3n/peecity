## 🎯 Objective

Final production optimization: bundle analysis, performance tuning, security hardening, monitoring setup, and deployment preparation.

## 📝 Context

This is the final **Refactor** phase for the entire epic. With a fully functional and tested application, the focus shifts to final production hardening. This includes a deep analysis of the application bundle, implementing security headers, setting up production monitoring and error tracking, and ensuring the application is fully optimized for a fast and secure deployment.
