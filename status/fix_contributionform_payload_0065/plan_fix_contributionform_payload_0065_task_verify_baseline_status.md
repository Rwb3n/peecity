## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/architecture-spec.md`, `docs/engineering-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `verify_baseline` from `plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`

**Testing Tools**: Jest, @testing-library/react

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/cookbook/recipe_robust_react_testing.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Run the full ContributionForm test suite to confirm all 26 tests are passing, document the current payload structure, and create a new git branch for isolation.

## 📝 Context

This is the safety pre-condition step for fixing a critical bug where ContributionForm collects feature data but fails to include it in the API payload. We must establish a known-good baseline before making any changes.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Run ContributionForm test suite to verify all 26 tests pass
2. Capture and document current API payload structure
3. Create new git branch 'fix/contribution-form-payload'
4. Update status report with findings
