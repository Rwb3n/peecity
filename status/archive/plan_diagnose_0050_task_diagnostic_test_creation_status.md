## 📚 Appropriate References

**Issue**: `issues/issue_0050.txt`
**Parent Plan**: `plan_diagnose_0050.txt`
**Original Failures**: From `SearchBar_test.tsx` and `MarkerPopup_test.tsx`

## 🎯 Objective

Create a diagnostic test file containing only the failing tests from SearchBar and MarkerPopup components to isolate and analyze the regression failures.

## 📝 Context

After four failed validation attempts with the molecules_implementation task, including regressions in previously working components, a diagnostic approach is required. This task creates an isolated test environment to analyze the exact failures without noise from passing tests.

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created new test file: `tests/diagnostics/molecule_regression_diag_test.tsx`
- Extracted 5 specific failing tests from the original test suites:
  1. SearchBar keyboard navigation test
  2. SearchBar aria-busy attribute test  
  3. MarkerPopup action buttons rendering test
  4. MarkerPopup compact mode visibility test
  5. MarkerPopup keyboard navigation test
- Included necessary imports and mock data setup
- Did NOT modify any production code
- Did NOT modify original test files

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/diagnostics/molecule_regression_diag_test.tsx` | test | Created - Diagnostic test file with 5 failing tests |
| `status/plan_diagnose_0050_task_diagnostic_test_creation_status.md` | doc | Created - This status report |

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 175

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Successfully created the diagnostic test file to isolate the failing tests. This file will:
- Confirm the exact nature of the failures
- Provide a focused environment for debugging
- Prevent further destabilization of the codebase

The diagnostic test should be run to verify it reproduces the documented failures before any attempt to fix production code.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Details:** The diagnostic test suite was executed and, as expected, it **FAILED**. All 5 isolated tests failed with the exact errors documented in `issue_0050.txt`. This confirms the diagnostic hypotheses and provides a reliable, focused test case for remediation.
*   **Test Suites**: 1 failed, 1 total
*   **Tests**: 5 failed, 5 total
*   **Conclusion**: The diagnosis is validated. The root causes are confirmed to be implementation errors related to focus order, ARIA attributes, and component logic that misinterprets the test specifications.
