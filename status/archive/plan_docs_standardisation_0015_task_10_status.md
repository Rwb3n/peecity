## üìö Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/cookbook/recipe_docs_structure.md - Documentation structure patterns

**Parent Plan Task**: `10` - Add Prometheus exporter best-practices recipe

**Testing Tools**: Jest, gray-matter, AJV, scaffolding CLI

**Cookbook Patterns**: TDD Green phase implementation, technical cookbook creation

## üéØ Objective

Create a comprehensive Prometheus exporter best-practices recipe covering naming conventions, labels, HELP strings, and maintainability principles, making the first 6 failing tests from Task 9 pass while maintaining all existing test coverage.

## üìù Context

This task represents the TDD Green phase for the first content file implementation, following the failing tests established in Task 9. The goal is to create a production-ready cookbook recipe that provides practical guidance for implementing Prometheus exporters in the CityPee context.

## ü™ú Task Steps Summary

1. **Scaffolding Generation**: Used scaffold-doc.js CLI to generate initial structure
2. **Content Development**: Created comprehensive recipe with 6 major sections
3. **Technical Implementation**: Added concrete code examples and best practices
4. **CityPee Integration**: Contextualized examples for validation service architecture
5. **Test Validation**: Verified all 6 Prometheus exporter tests pass
6. **Schema Compliance**: Ensured documentation meets project standards

## üß† Knowledge Capture

- **Prometheus Best Practices**: Comprehensive coverage of naming, labels, HELP strings, and maintainability
- **Code Examples**: Practical JavaScript implementations using prom-client library
- **CityPee Context**: Specific examples for tier validation metrics and patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions for production deployments
- **Cross-references**: Links to related documentation and external resources

## üõ† Actions Taken

- Generated initial structure using scaffold-doc.js CLI with proper front-matter
- Created comprehensive recipe covering all required technical areas
- Added detailed implementation examples with Node.js/prom-client code
- Included CityPee-specific validation service integration patterns
- Provided troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
- Added extensive cross-references to related documentation
- Verified all 6 Prometheus exporter tests now pass
- Confirmed no regression in existing documentation tests (44 files validated)
- Updated plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt Task 10 status to DONE
- Incremented aiconfig.json global event counter to 110

## üì¶ Artifacts Produced / Modified

| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `docs/cookbook/recipe_prometheus_exporter.md` | cookbook | Comprehensive Prometheus exporter best-practices guide |
| `plans/plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt` | plan | Updated Task 10 status to DONE |
| `aiconfig.json` | config | Incremented global event counter to 110 |

## üîó Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 9 (stub tests) completed successfully with 26 failing tests
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.x, scaffolding CLI, prom-client library patterns operational

## üìã Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Exceeded expectations - Created comprehensive cookbook with extensive code examples, CityPee integration, and production-ready guidance.

## ‚úÖ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions validated - content comprehensive, tests passing, schema compliance confirmed
**Details:** Prometheus exporter tests: 6/6 passed (TDD Green phase complete). Schema validation: 44 files validated successfully (new file included). No regression in existing tests. 20 tests remain failing for k6 guide and ADR-005 as expected.

## üîó Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - Recipe includes comprehensive cross-references and context
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - Recipe references appropriate architecture, API, and operational documentation

## üèÅ Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 110 (incremented from previous state)

## üåç Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: 
- **Technical Guidance**: Comprehensive Prometheus exporter implementation guide
- **TDD Progress**: First content file complete, 6 tests now passing
- **Developer Resources**: Practical code examples and best practices
- **CityPee Integration**: Contextualized examples for validation service architecture

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Task 11: Add k6 load-testing how-to guide
- Task 12: Author ADR-005 Prometheus Native Histograms adoption

## üöÄ Next Steps Preparation

- [x] Task 10 marked as DONE in plan
- [x] Comprehensive Prometheus exporter recipe implemented
- [x] All 6 related tests now passing
- [x] Schema validation confirmed for new content
- [ ] Begin Task 11: k6 load-testing guide implementation
- [ ] Continue TDD Green phase for remaining content files

**Content Implementation Progress**: 1/3 complete - Prometheus exporter recipe operational
