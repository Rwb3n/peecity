## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/cookbook/recipe_docs_structure.md - Documentation structure patterns

**Parent Plan Task**: `9` - Stub tests for new content files (exporter, k6, ADR-005)

**Testing Tools**: Jest, gray-matter, AJV, Node.js --experimental-vm-modules

**Cookbook Patterns**: TDD Red phase implementation, content validation testing

## 🎯 Objective

Create comprehensive failing tests for three new content files that will be implemented in subsequent tasks: Prometheus exporter recipe, k6 load-testing guide, and ADR-005 Native Histograms, ensuring all tests properly fail to establish the TDD Red phase.

## 📝 Context

This task represents the TDD Red phase for new content validation, following the successful completion of the documentation tooling system. The goal is to create robust tests that define the structure and requirements for upcoming content implementation tasks.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. **Test File Creation**: Created comprehensive test suite in tests/docs/new_content_test.js
2. **Content Validation Tests**: Implemented tests for all three required content files
3. **Schema Integration**: Integrated front-matter schema validation for all new content
4. **Structure Validation**: Created tests for required sections and content patterns
5. **Integration Testing**: Added cross-content validation for consistency
6. **Test Execution**: Verified all 26 tests fail as expected (TDD Red phase)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- **Test Structure**: Organized tests by content type with dedicated describe blocks
- **Schema Validation**: All content must comply with docs_frontmatter_schema.json
- **Content Requirements**: Each document type has specific structural requirements
- **Integration Patterns**: Cross-content validation ensures consistency
- **TDD Red Phase**: All tests must fail initially to establish clear requirements

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created comprehensive test suite with 26 failing tests covering all new content requirements
- Implemented schema validation tests for all three content files
- Added category-specific structure validation (cookbook, howto, adr patterns)
- Created content-specific tests for technical requirements (Prometheus, k6, native histograms)
- Added integration tests for consistency across all new content files
- Verified all tests fail as expected and existing tests continue to pass
- Updated plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt Task 9 status to DONE
- Incremented aiconfig.json global event counter to 109

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified

| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/docs/new_content_test.js` | test suite | Comprehensive failing tests for 3 new content files |
| `plans/plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt` | plan | Updated Task 9 status to DONE |
| `aiconfig.json` | config | Incremented global event counter to 109 |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 8 (documentation tooling) completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: Jest, gray-matter@4, AJV@8, Node.js --experimental-vm-modules operational

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Met expectations - Created comprehensive test suite with 26 failing tests covering all content requirements.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions validated - test structure comprehensive, schema integration operational, TDD Red phase established
**Details:** New content tests: 26/26 failing as expected (TDD Red phase complete). Existing docs tests: 7 passed, 1 skipped (no regression). Clear requirements established.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - Test files include comprehensive documentation and cross-references
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - Tests reference appropriate schema and documentation patterns

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 109 (incremented from previous state)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: 
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation requirements for all new content files
- **TDD Red Phase**: Clear failing tests establish implementation requirements
- **Content Standards**: Enforced consistency across cookbook, howto, and ADR categories
- **Quality Assurance**: Schema validation ensures front-matter compliance

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Task 10: Add Prometheus exporter best-practices recipe
- Task 11: Add k6 load-testing how-to guide
- Task 12: Author ADR-005 Prometheus Native Histograms adoption

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- [x] Task 9 marked as DONE in plan
- [x] Complete test suite with 26 failing tests implemented
- [x] Schema validation integrated for all content types
- [x] Content structure requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Begin Task 10: Prometheus exporter recipe implementation
- [ ] Prepare for content creation phase with clear test requirements

**Content Implementation Readiness**: ✅ READY - Complete test foundation established with clear requirements

## 📊 Test Suite Summary

### Test Coverage Breakdown
- **Prometheus Exporter Recipe**: 6 tests covering existence, schema, structure, and technical content
- **k6 Load Testing Guide**: 7 tests covering howto patterns, k6 concepts, and API integration
- **ADR-005 Native Histograms**: 8 tests covering ADR structure, decision rationale, and implementation
- **Integration Tests**: 5 tests covering cross-content consistency and quality

### Test Categories
1. **File Existence**: All three files must exist at specified paths
2. **Schema Compliance**: Front-matter must validate against docs_frontmatter_schema.json
3. **Category Validation**: Correct category assignment (cookbook, howto, adr)
4. **Structural Requirements**: Required sections for each document type
5. **Technical Content**: Specific terminology and concepts for each domain
6. **Integration Consistency**: Author information, dates, and tags across all files

### Expected Content Structure
- **Prometheus Exporter Recipe**: Overview, Prerequisites, Implementation, Best Practices, Usage Examples
- **k6 Load Testing Guide**: Problem, Solution Overview, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step Guide, Verification, Troubleshooting
- **ADR-005 Native Histograms**: Context, Decision, Consequences, Implementation, Alternatives Considered

### Key Test Assertions
- All files must exist and be readable
- Front-matter must be valid according to schema
- Content must include required sections and technical terminology
- Integration patterns must be consistent across all files
- Author information and dates must be properly formatted
