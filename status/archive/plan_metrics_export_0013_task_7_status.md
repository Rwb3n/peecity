**Parent Plan Task**: `7` <!-- from plan_metrics_export_0013.txt -->

**Testing Tools**: Jest, child_process.execSync, fs

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/cookbook/recipe_metrics_export.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Write tests for CI pipeline script that validates performance against ADR-004 SLAs. Tests should verify the script correctly identifies performance regressions and returns appropriate exit codes.

## 📝 Context

Following the metrics export implementation, we need CI guardrails to prevent performance regressions. This RED phase task creates comprehensive tests for a performance validation script that will run in CI pipelines to ensure validation performance stays within ADR-004 SLAs (15ms minimal, 20ms full for local; 20ms minimal, 30ms full for CI).

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Created comprehensive test suite for validate-performance.js ✅
2. Tested script existence and basic functionality ✅
3. Added tests for threshold configuration loading ✅
4. Created tests for performance benchmark execution ✅
5. Added tests for SLA violation detection and reporting ✅
6. Created tests for various report formats (JSON, Markdown) ✅
7. Added CI integration tests (GitHub Actions) ✅
8. Included advanced option tests (custom thresholds, warmup) ✅

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Used conditional test execution (describe.skip) to handle missing script gracefully
- Tests cover all acceptance criteria including exit codes, report generation, and CI modes
- Performance thresholds loaded from aiconfig.json validated_patterns.performance_targets
- Script should support both local and CI environments with different thresholds
- Comprehensive test coverage includes edge cases like custom overrides and interruption handling

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created `/tests/scripts/validate_performance_test.js` with 20 comprehensive tests
- Implemented helper function `runScript` for consistent script execution
- Added script existence check as the primary failing test
- Used `describeIfScriptExists` pattern to skip other tests when script missing
- Covered all required features: benchmarking, SLA detection, reporting, CI integration
- Tests verify proper exit codes (0 for pass, 1 for SLA violation)

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 6 is DONE
**External Dependencies Available**: Yes - Node.js, Jest, fs, child_process available

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed as expected. Tests properly fail in RED phase with clear error indicating missing script.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All assumptions about CI script requirements validated
**Details:** 
- 1 test fails (script existence check) ✅
- 19 tests skipped (would run if script existed) ✅
- Clear failure message: "Expected: true, Received: false" for script existence
- Tests ready to pass once validate-performance.js is implemented in Task 8

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - test file contains @artifact, @task, and @tdd-phase annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Points to docs/cookbook/recipe_metrics_export.md

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 91

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Task 7 successfully completed with failing tests for CI performance validation:
- Comprehensive test coverage for all script features ✅
- Proper RED phase implementation with clear failure ✅
- Tests document expected script behavior ✅
- Ready for GREEN phase implementation in Task 8 ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

Ready to proceed with Task 8: Implement CI performance validation script to make all tests pass.
