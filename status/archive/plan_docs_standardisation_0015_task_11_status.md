## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/cookbook/recipe_docs_structure.md - Documentation structure patterns

**Parent Plan Task**: `11` - Add k6 load-testing how-to guide

**Testing Tools**: Jest, gray-matter, AJV, scaffolding CLI

**Cookbook Patterns**: TDD Green phase implementation, technical how-to creation

## 🎯 Objective

Create a comprehensive k6 load-testing how-to guide covering smoke tests, soak tests, thresholds, checks, output analysis, and compact mode, making the next 7 failing tests from Task 9 pass while maintaining all existing test coverage.

## 📝 Context

This task represents the TDD Green phase for the second content file implementation, following the successful completion of the Prometheus exporter recipe. The goal is to create a production-ready how-to guide that provides practical load testing guidance for the CityPee validation API.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. **Scaffolding Generation**: Used scaffold-doc.js CLI to generate initial structure
2. **Content Development**: Created comprehensive guide with 6 major sections covering all k6 concepts
3. **Technical Implementation**: Added concrete code examples for smoke tests, soak tests, and advanced scenarios
4. **CityPee Integration**: Contextualized examples for validation service and tier-based testing
5. **Test Validation**: Verified all 7 k6 guide tests pass
6. **Schema Compliance**: Ensured documentation meets project standards

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- **k6 Load Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of smoke tests, soak tests, thresholds, checks, and output analysis
- **Code Examples**: Practical JavaScript implementations for multiple test scenarios
- **CityPee Context**: Specific examples for validation API testing and tier-based performance validation
- **CI/CD Integration**: Compact mode usage and automated testing patterns
- **Cross-references**: Links to related documentation and external resources

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Generated initial structure using scaffold-doc.js CLI with proper front-matter
- Created comprehensive guide covering all required k6 concepts and techniques
- Added detailed implementation examples for smoke tests, soak tests, and performance tests
- Included CityPee-specific validation API integration patterns and tier-based testing
- Provided troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
- Added extensive cross-references to related documentation and k6 resources
- Verified all 7 k6 guide tests now pass
- Confirmed no regression in existing documentation tests (45 files validated)
- Updated plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt Task 11 status to DONE

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 9 (stub tests) completed successfully with failing tests established
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.x, scaffolding CLI, k6 testing framework patterns operational

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Exceeded expectations - Created comprehensive how-to guide with extensive k6 examples, CityPee integration, and CI/CD patterns.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions validated - content comprehensive, tests passing, schema compliance confirmed
**Details:** k6 guide tests: 7/7 passed (TDD Green phase complete). Schema validation: 45 files validated successfully (new file included). No regression in existing tests. 13 tests remain failing for ADR-005 as expected.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - Guide includes comprehensive cross-references and context
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - Guide references appropriate architecture, API, and operational documentation

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 111 (maintained current state)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: 
- **Load Testing Guidance**: Comprehensive k6 implementation guide for CityPee validation API
- **TDD Progress**: Second content file complete, 13 tests now passing (6 Prometheus + 7 k6)
- **Developer Resources**: Practical code examples and testing patterns
- **CI/CD Integration**: Compact mode and automated testing guidance

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Task 12: Author ADR-005 Prometheus Native Histograms adoption
