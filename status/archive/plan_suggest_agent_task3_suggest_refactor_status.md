2. Optimize duplicate detection algorithm for better performance
3. Create configuration utilities for validation rules
4. Refactor API route handler for better modularity
5. Extract error handling patterns into shared utilities
6. Create cookbook documentation for suggest-agent patterns
7. Ensure all existing tests remain green throughout refactoring
8. Verify performance improvements and maintainability gains
