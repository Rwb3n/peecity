## 🎯 Objective

Create failing test for Storybook setup verification with TailwindCSS import - implementing RED phase of TDD cycle to validate Storybook installation requirements.

## 📝 Context

This task creates the foundational test infrastructure for the Frontend UI epic. The test verifies Storybook configuration, TailwindCSS integration, and process execution requirements before implementation begins. This follows the strict TDD methodology where tests must fail initially (RED phase) before implementation (GREEN phase).

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Created comprehensive test suite for Storybook setup verification
2. Implemented tests for configuration files, TailwindCSS integration, and package dependencies
3. Added process execution test to verify Storybook startup functionality
4. Validated test failure scenarios as expected in RED phase

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Storybook process testing requires careful timeout handling (30s timeout implemented)
- TailwindCSS integration testing must verify both configuration and import patterns
- Package.json script validation essential for npm run commands
- File existence tests provide quick validation of setup requirements

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created comprehensive test file `tests/storybook_setup_test.js`
- Implemented 8 test cases covering all Storybook setup requirements
- Added artifact annotations linking to frontend-ui-spec.md
- Verified test failures align with RED phase expectations

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - No prior task dependencies for this first task
**External Dependencies Available**: Jest (✓), child_process (✓), fs (✓), path (✓) - all Node.js built-ins available

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task proceeded exactly as predicted. Tests fail as expected in RED phase, confirming Storybook is not yet installed/configured.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** Critical assumptions validated - Storybook not installed, TailwindCSS exists, package.json structure correct
**Details:** Test run shows 5 failed tests (expected) and 3 passed tests (TailwindCSS configuration already present). Failures confirm Storybook configuration missing, no storybook script in package.json, and required dependencies not installed.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - test file contains comprehensive artifact annotation
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - pointer to docs/frontend-ui-spec.md added with epic/plan/task references

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 25

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: Established baseline test infrastructure for Frontend UI epic. RED phase validation confirms current system state and provides clear requirements for Storybook implementation.

**Immediate Follow-up**: Ready to proceed with `storybook_impl` task (GREEN phase) to install and configure Storybook 7.x with required dependencies.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- Next task: `storybook_impl` (IMPLEMENTATION) 
- Required dependencies: @storybook/nextjs@^7.6.3, @storybook/addon-essentials@^7.6.3, @storybook/addon-a11y@^7.6.3, @storybook/addon-viewport@^7.6.3
- Configuration files needed: .storybook/main.ts, .storybook/preview.js
- Package.json script addition: "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006"
