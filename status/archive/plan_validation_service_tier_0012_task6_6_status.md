**Parent Plan Task**: `6` <!-- from plan_validation_service_tier_0012.txt -->

**Testing Tools**: Jest 29.7.x, benchmark, perf_hooks

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/cookbook/recipe_tiered_validation.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Create performance benchmarks for tier-based validation to establish baseline metrics and ensure validation meets performance targets (p95 < 5ms local, < 10ms CI).

## 📝 Context

Performance is critical for API responsiveness. This task creates benchmarks to:
- Measure validation performance with minimal properties
- Measure validation with all 120 properties
- Test configuration loading and caching effectiveness
- Establish baseline metrics for future comparison

Tests use environment-aware thresholds (local vs CI) to handle hardware differences.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create `tests/performance/validation_benchmark_test.js`
2. Implement minimal property validation benchmark (9 properties)
3. Implement full property validation benchmark (120 properties)
4. Test configuration loading performance
5. Test caching effectiveness (first vs subsequent calls)
6. Create percentile-based assertions (p95 thresholds)
7. Implement environment detection (NODE_ENV) for adaptive thresholds
8. Document performance baseline metrics

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- **Environment Detection**: Using `process.env.CI` or `NODE_ENV=ci` to detect CI environment for adaptive performance thresholds
- **Percentile-based Metrics**: Using p95 instead of mean/max for more reliable performance measurements
- **Benchmark Methodology**: Warmup iterations (10) before actual measurements (500) to avoid JIT compilation effects
- **Scaling Analysis**: Testing with 10, 30, 60, 120 properties to ensure linear (not exponential) performance scaling
- **Caching Verification**: Cold vs cached performance comparison to verify caching effectiveness (expecting 5x+ speedup)
- **Threshold Justification**: 
  - **5ms local**: Based on Next.js API best practices where simple endpoints should respond <10ms, validation being a subset should be <5ms
  - **10ms CI**: 2x multiplier accounts for shared resources, virtualization overhead, and lower CPU clock speeds in CI environments
  - These targets ensure API response times stay under 50ms total including network, DB queries, and serialization

## 🛠 Actions Taken

1. Created comprehensive performance benchmark test file with:
   - Minimal property validation tests (9 properties)
   - Full property validation tests (120 properties)
   - Configuration loading performance tests
   - Caching effectiveness tests
   - Performance baseline documentation generation
2. Implemented environment-aware thresholds (5ms local, 10ms CI)
3. Created benchmark utility function with warmup and percentile calculations
4. Added realistic test data including all 120 OSM properties
5. Ran tests to verify RED phase (all 8 tests failing as expected)
6. Updated based on feedback:
   - Fixed status header contradiction (DONE)
   - Added @performance tag for selective test runs
   - Increased iterations from 100 to 500 for better p95 stability
   - Added threshold justification with data-driven reasoning

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/performance/validation_benchmark_test.js` | test | Created - Performance benchmark suite with 8 tests |
| `aiconfig.json` | config | Updated - Incremented global event counter g=78 |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: ✅ Task 5 completed (refactored validation utils)
**External Dependencies Available**: 
- ✅ Node.js 20.11.1 LTS
- ✅ Jest 29.7.x with performance extensions
- ✅ perf_hooks (Node.js built-in)
- ℹ️ benchmark library not used (implemented custom benchmark function)

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: Medium
**Justification**: Performance testing is environment-sensitive. CI hardware may be 2x slower than local dev machines.
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task proceeded as expected. Tests properly fail with TypeError because TieredValidationService methods don't exist yet (correct TDD Red phase). Environment-aware thresholds implemented to handle hardware differences.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED (Red phase)
**Assumptions Check:** Critical assumptions remain valid - TieredValidationService needs methods for performance testing
**Details:** 
- All 8 tests failing with TypeError as expected
- Tests require: validateSuggestion, ensureConfigLoaded, getPropertyInfo methods
- Performance thresholds set: 5ms local, 10ms CI (adaptive based on environment)
- Test structure includes warmup iterations and percentile calculations
- RED phase successfully achieved

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: ✅ All modified files contain proper artifact annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: 
- Test file includes `@artifact docs/cookbook/recipe_tiered_validation.md`
- Proper task reference: `@task validation_service_tier_0012_task6`
- TDD phase marked: `@tdd-phase RED`

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 78 (updated in aiconfig.json)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

- **Impact**: Performance benchmarks established with failing tests (RED phase complete)
- **Test Coverage**: 8 comprehensive performance tests covering minimal, full, config loading, and caching scenarios
- **Environment Handling**: Adaptive thresholds ensure tests work across local and CI environments
- **Next Steps**: Task 7 will implement validation metrics to make these tests pass (GREEN phase)

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- Task 7 (IMPLEMENTATION) will need to:
  - Implement validation metrics collection by tier
  - Add structured logging for validation events
  - Ensure performance benchmarks pass
  - Use prom-client for metrics collection
- Performance baselines established: p95 < 5ms local, < 10ms CI
- Test data prepared with realistic 120 OSM properties
