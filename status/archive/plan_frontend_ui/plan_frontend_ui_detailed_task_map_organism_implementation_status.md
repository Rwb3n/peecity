## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `map_organism_implementation` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**External Dependencies**: `react-leaflet`, `leaflet`, `react-leaflet-markercluster`

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/components/organisms/MapView/MapView.tsx`
- `src/components/organisms/MapView/index.ts`
- `src/hooks/useToiletData.ts`
- `src/hooks/useUserLocation.ts`
- `src/components/organisms/index.ts`

## 🎯 Objective

Implement MapView organism with React-Leaflet, marker clustering, real toilet data integration, mobile-optimized controls, and ergonomic positioning.

## 📝 Context

This is the **Green** phase for the MapView organism. The goal is to write the implementation code that satisfies the Jest tests and makes the Storybook story render correctly. This involves integrating the Leaflet library, loading and processing the GeoJSON toilet data, and managing map state and user interactions.
