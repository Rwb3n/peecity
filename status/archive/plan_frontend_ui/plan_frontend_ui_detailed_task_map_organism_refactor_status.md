## 🎯 Objective

Optimize MapView for mobile performance, implement proper memory management, enhance clustering algorithm, and improve touch responsiveness.

## 📝 Context

This is the **Refactor** phase for the MapView organism. Performance is critical for a map with over 1,000 markers. This task focuses on optimizing the map's performance on mobile devices, preventing memory leaks from the Leaflet library, and fine-tuning the user's touch interaction experience. The confidence level is low because map performance can be highly device-dependent and require significant iteration.
