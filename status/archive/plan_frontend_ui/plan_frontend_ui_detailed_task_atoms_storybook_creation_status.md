**Plan**: `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`
**Task**: `atoms_storybook_creation`
**Type**: TEST_CREATION
**TDD Phase**: Red
**Status**: COMPLETED

## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`, `docs/cookbook/recipe_storybook_setup.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `atoms_storybook_creation` in `plans/plan_frontend_ui_detailed.txt`

**External Dependencies**: `@storybook/nextjs`

**Target Storybook Files**:
- `src/components/atoms/Button/Button.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/atoms/Input/Input.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/atoms/Icon/Icon.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/atoms/Badge/Badge.stories.tsx`

## 🎯 Objective

Create placeholder Storybook stories for atomic design Level 1 components (Button, Input, Icon, Badge) to establish the visual test harness. Stories will initially fail to render.

## 📝 Context

This task runs in parallel with Jest test creation and establishes the second half of our 'Red' phase test harness. By creating placeholder Storybook files, we achieve two goals:

1.  **Visual Test Harness**: We prepare the ground for visual validation. Once the components are implemented, these stories will allow us to instantly see and interact with them.
2.  **Strict TDD Compliance**: The stories will fail to render because the components do not exist yet. This proves that our visual specification is being defined *before* implementation, just like our unit tests.

This explicitly addresses the project's need for robust visual validation from the earliest stage.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Verify task definition against plan file to ensure paths and dependencies align.
2. Confirm documentation references exist (`docs/frontend-ui-spec.md`, `recipe_storybook_setup.md`).
3. Check `package.json` for `@storybook/nextjs` dependency – present via `devDependencies` (`^8.1.0`).
4. Ensure task dependencies (`setup_environment`) are marked DONE.

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Created comprehensive Storybook stories using CSF3 format with TypeScript
- Stories follow Red phase TDD - import non-existent components (will fail to render)
- Each component has 20-25 stories covering all variants, states, and use cases
- Included interactive examples, accessibility patterns, and mobile ergonomics showcases
- Used Meta type with satisfies operator for better type safety

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created directory structure: `src/components/atoms/{Button,Input,Icon,Badge}/`
- Implemented Button stories (24 stories) covering:
  - All 6 variants with visual examples
  - Size variations including icon-only buttons
  - Loading states with and without loading text
  - Interactive states showcase
  - AsChild pattern for polymorphic components
  - Mobile touch target demonstrations
- Implemented Input stories (22 stories) covering:
  - Multiple HTML5 input types
  - Size variants with mobile optimization
  - Error states and validation patterns
  - Form integration examples
  - Accessibility with labels and help text
- Implemented Icon stories (25 stories) covering:
  - Lucide React icon integration examples
  - Size and color variant demonstrations
  - Interactive states with touch targets
  - Animation patterns (spin, pulse, bounce)
  - Decorative vs meaningful icon patterns
  - Navigation and status icon use cases
- Implemented Badge stories (23 stories) covering:
  - Status and label badge patterns
  - Notification positioning (4 corners)
  - Count display with overflow handling
  - Dot indicators for minimal notifications
  - Animation effects for attention
  - Accessibility with aria-live regions

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `src/components/atoms/Button/Button.stories.tsx` | code | Created - 24 stories for Button component |
| `src/components/atoms/Input/Input.stories.tsx` | code | Created - 22 stories for Input component |
| `src/components/atoms/Icon/Icon.stories.tsx` | code | Created - 25 stories for Icon component |
| `src/components/atoms/Badge/Badge.stories.tsx` | code | Created - 23 stories for Badge component |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes – `setup_environment` completed.  
**External Dependencies Available**: `@storybook/nextjs` **INSTALLED** (devDependency).

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High  
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed as expected. All story files created following TDD Red phase principles. Stories will fail to render since components don't exist yet.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** Storybook stories are expected to fail to render due to missing component modules.  
**Details:**
- Verified presence of all 4 Storybook story files at specified paths.
- Each story imports its respective component from `./Component`, which does not yet exist – confirming Red phase.
- Attempted `npm run build-storybook`, which failed as expected due to missing modules, thereby validating Red-phase failure conditions.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A - Story files in Red phase don't require artifact annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Stories reference component behavior implicitly through story variations

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE  
**Global event counter (g):** 160

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Visual test harness established for atomic components. The project now has comprehensive Storybook stories defining the visual specifications and interaction patterns for Button, Input, Icon, and Badge components. These failing stories provide the visual blueprint for the Green phase implementation.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

Both test harnesses now complete:
- Jest tests created (atoms_jest_test_creation) ✓
- Storybook stories created (atoms_storybook_creation) ✓

Ready to proceed to `atoms_implementation` (Green phase) to implement the actual components.
