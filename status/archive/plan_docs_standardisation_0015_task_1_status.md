## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/engineering-spec.md, docs/reference/frontmatter_examples.md

**Parent Plan Task**: `1` from plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt

**Testing Tools**: Jest, gray-matter, ajv, markdownlint

**Cookbook Patterns**: docs/cookbook/recipe_aiconfig_patterns.md

## 🎯 Objective

Create failing Jest tests that validate all markdown files against the front-matter schema using gray-matter and Ajv, establishing the "Red" phase of TDD for documentation standardization.

## 📝 Context

This task implements the Red phase of TDD for documentation standardization. With the schema defined in Task 0, we now create comprehensive tests that will initially fail because existing documentation lacks consistent front-matter. These tests will validate all 41 markdown files against the unified schema and establish baseline markdownlint compliance.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create Jest test file in tests/docs/docs_schema_test.js
2. Implement front-matter parsing with gray-matter for all .md files
3. Add Ajv schema validation against docs_frontmatter_schema.json
4. Include markdownlint baseline validation tests
5. Verify tests fail as expected (documenting current non-compliance)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Successfully implemented comprehensive Jest test suite for documentation validation
- Discovered 41 markdown files requiring standardization across 9 categories
- Validated TDD Red phase - tests fail as expected due to missing front-matter fields
- Established baseline for markdownlint compliance testing
- Confirmed schema validation works correctly with AJV and gray-matter integration

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created comprehensive test file `tests/docs/docs_schema_test.js` with 8 test cases
- Installed required dependencies: gray-matter, ajv, ajv-formats, markdownlint
- Implemented recursive markdown file discovery across all docs directories
- Added front-matter parsing and schema validation with detailed error reporting
- Included markdownlint baseline testing with configurable rules
- Verified TDD Red phase with failing tests on docs/README.md (missing description field)

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/docs/docs_schema_test.js` | test | created - comprehensive schema validation test suite |
| `docs_frontmatter_schema.json` | schema | updated - fixed schema reference for AJV compatibility |
| `package.json` | config | updated - added testing dependencies |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 0 (schema definition) completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.11.1, Jest 29.7.x, gray-matter@4, ajv@8, markdownlint@0.37

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed exactly as planned with comprehensive failing tests establishing TDD Red phase

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All assumptions validated - 41 files discovered, tests fail as expected for TDD Red phase
**Details:** Tests successfully fail due to missing required front-matter fields (e.g., docs/README.md missing 'description'). Schema validation and markdownlint integration working correctly. Perfect TDD Red phase establishment.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - test file contains proper artifact annotations pointing to engineering-spec.md
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - annotations reference docs/engineering-spec.md#documentation-standards

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 96

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Established comprehensive testing foundation for documentation standardization. The failing tests provide clear validation criteria for Task 2 (implementation) to create lint tooling and CI integration. Ready to move to TDD Green phase.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- Test suite ready for Task 2 implementation validation  
- Dependencies installed and configured
- Clear failure patterns identified for remediation
- Schema validation pipeline established
