## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/architecture-spec.md#suggest-agent, docs/engineering-spec.md#testing

**Parent Plan Task**: `refactor_suggest_agent_tests` <!-- from plan_0004.txt -->

**Testing Tools**: <!-- Jest, @testing-library/react, nock, supertest, jsdom, sinon, nodemailer-mock, shelljs -->

**Cookbook Patterns**: <!-- docs/cookbook/recipe_*.md if applicable -->

## 🎯 Objective

Split monolithic suggest-agent test file into focused suites leveraging new helper utilities, enforcing DRY/KISS/SOLID while maintaining failing Red baseline for forthcoming implementation.

## 📝 Context

<!-- Background information, links to specs, why this task exists -->

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Created six new test files (validation, duplicates, rate_limit, logging, response_format) under tests/agents/.
2. Utilised helper factories and fs utils; removed duplication and hard-coded literals.
3. Deleted obsolete large test file already removed in prior task.
4. Ran Jest; 6 new suites fail as expected, others pass.
5. Updated plan and global counter.

**Original Confidence Level**: <!-- High/Medium/Low from plan -->
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: <!-- Did task proceed as predicted? Any deviations? --> *[To be populated during task execution]*

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED (expected failing Red tests present; helper-based suites execute)  
**Assumptions Check:** No critical assumptions violated.  
**Details:** Jest reports 51 total tests, 12 failures in new suites establishing baseline; prior suites unaffected.
