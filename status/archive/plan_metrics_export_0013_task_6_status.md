## üéØ Objective

Optimize summary API with response caching, efficient percentile algorithms, and pre-aggregation for common queries. Add ETag support for client-side caching.

## üìù Context

Following successful implementation of the validation summary API in Task 5, this refactoring task adds performance optimizations including response caching (60 seconds), ETag support for client-side caching, memory-efficient streaming percentile algorithms, and cache invalidation on metrics reset.

## ü™ú Task Steps Summary

1. Created memory cache utility with TTL support ‚úÖ
2. Implemented streaming percentile calculator using reservoir sampling ‚úÖ
3. Added response caching to summary API (60 second TTL) ‚úÖ
4. Implemented ETag/If-None-Match support for 304 responses ‚úÖ
5. Created metrics aggregation service for pre-computed percentiles ‚úÖ
6. Added compression headers to responses ‚úÖ
7. Integrated cache invalidation with metrics reset ‚úÖ
8. Created comprehensive cache tests ‚úÖ

## üß† Knowledge Capture

- In-memory caching with TTL provides fast response times for repeated queries
- ETag support enables efficient client-side caching with 304 Not Modified responses
- Reservoir sampling algorithm allows memory-efficient percentile calculation for large datasets
- Cache invalidation must be integrated with metrics reset to maintain data consistency
- Test environment requires careful NextResponse polyfilling for API route testing
- Compression headers signal support but actual compression handled by Next.js middleware

## üõ† Actions Taken

- Created `/src/utils/cache.ts` with MemoryCache class supporting TTL and ETag generation
- Created `/src/utils/percentiles.ts` with StreamingPercentileCalculator using reservoir sampling
- Updated `/src/app/api/validation/summary/route.ts` to add caching, ETag support, and compression headers
- Created `/src/services/MetricsAggregationService.ts` for periodic percentile pre-computation
- Modified `/src/services/TieredValidationServiceWithMetrics.ts` to trigger cache invalidation on reset
- Created `/tests/api/validation_summary_cache_test.js` with 7 comprehensive cache tests
- Fixed NextResponse polyfill for test environment compatibility

## üì¶ Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `src/utils/cache.ts` | code | Created - In-memory cache with TTL and ETag support |
| `src/utils/percentiles.ts` | code | Created - Streaming percentile calculator |
| `src/services/MetricsAggregationService.ts` | code | Created - Pre-aggregation service |
| `src/app/api/validation/summary/route.ts` | code | Modified - Added caching, ETag, compression |
| `src/services/TieredValidationServiceWithMetrics.ts` | code | Modified - Added cache invalidation on reset |
| `tests/api/validation_summary_cache_test.js` | test | Created - Cache behavior tests |

## üîó Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Tasks 4 and 5 are DONE
**External Dependencies Available**: Yes - Node.js crypto module for ETag generation, all Next.js APIs available

## üìã Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: Medium
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed successfully as planned. The Medium confidence was justified as cache coherency and ETag generation required careful implementation, but no major blockers were encountered.

## ‚úÖ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All caching assumptions validated - 60 second TTL appropriate, ETag generation working correctly
**Details:** 
- All 26 validation summary tests passing (19 original + 7 new cache tests)
- Response caching verified with X-Cache headers (HIT/MISS)
- ETag support working with 304 Not Modified responses
- Cache invalidation integrated with metrics reset
- Performance improvement confirmed: cached responses < 5ms

## üîó Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - all modified files contain @artifact, @task, and @tdd-phase annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Points to docs/cookbook/recipe_metrics_export.md

## üèÅ Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 90

## üåç Impact & Next Steps

Task 6 successfully completed with comprehensive caching and optimization:
- Response caching reduces server load for repeated queries ‚úÖ
- ETag support enables efficient client-side caching ‚úÖ
- Streaming percentiles ready for large-scale data processing ‚úÖ
- Pre-aggregation service foundation established ‚úÖ
- Cache invalidation ensures data consistency ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Next Steps Preparation

Ready to proceed with Task 7: Create failing CI performance guardrail tests for the validation pipeline script.
