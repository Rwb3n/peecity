## üìö Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/architecture-spec.md`, `docs/design-spec.md`, `docs/engineering-spec.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `changelog.md`, `README.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `audit_documentation_state` from `plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A (Documentation audit task)

**Cookbook Patterns**: N/A

## üéØ Objective

Perform comprehensive audit of all documentation files to identify specific outdated content, checking CLAUDE.md epic statuses, changelog.md last entry, aiconfig.json patterns, all README files, and incorrect file paths/locations.

## üìù Context

Multiple major epics have been completed (Ingest, Suggest, SEO, Monitor, Metrics) but documentation has not been updated to reflect the current state. The v2 migration work (plan_0066) and molecule debugging saga are also undocumented. Additionally, export.geojson is in the wrong location (docs/ instead of data/), blocking plan_0068.

## ü™ú Task Steps Summary

1. Audit CLAUDE.md for outdated epic statuses and missing service patterns
2. Check changelog.md for last entry date and missing work
3. Review aiconfig.json for missing validated patterns and outdated g counter
4. Scan all README files for outdated information
5. Verify file location references (especially export.geojson)
6. Create detailed checklist of all updates needed with line numbers

## üß† Knowledge Capture

**Pre-flight findings:**
- React-Leaflet is already installed (confirmed in package.json line 47)
- Multiple plans completed but not reflected in docs
- Critical blocker: export.geojson needs relocation before plan_0068

## üõ† Actions Taken

- Audited CLAUDE.md for outdated epic statuses and g counter
- Checked changelog.md for missing entries 
- Reviewed aiconfig.json for missing patterns and outdated counter
- Scanned README files for outdated information
- Searched for export.geojson references needing update
- Created detailed checklist with specific line numbers

| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Audit checklist | doc | Created with specific line numbers and content |

## üîó Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - No dependencies for this task
**External Dependencies Available**: File system access only

## üìã Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task executed as predicted - comprehensive audit completed with specific findings

## ‚úÖ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** All documentation files were accessible and audit revealed significant outdated content
**Details:** Found 7 critical categories of updates needed across multiple files with specific line numbers

### Key Findings Summary:
1. **g counter discrepancies**: CLAUDE.md shows 123, aiconfig.json shows 182, but changelog indicates 197
2. **Missing epic updates**: Frontend UI status doesn't reflect completed molecules
3. **File path issues**: 10 files still reference docs/export.geojson instead of data/toilets.geojson
4. **Missing cookbook recipes**: 4 new patterns need to be added to aiconfig.json
5. **Outdated bug reference**: Badge positioning bug (fixed in g=137) still mentioned in README
6. **Missing changelog entries**: Molecule debugging saga (g=191-197) not documented

## üîó Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A (Diagnostic task)
**Canonical Documentation**: N/A (Diagnostic task)

## üèÅ Final Status

**Status**: DONE  
**Global event counter (g):** 182 (from plan, but audit reveals it should be 197)

## üåç Impact & Next Steps

This audit provides a clear roadmap for documentation updates. Critical findings:
- g counter needs synchronization across all files
- export.geojson relocation is blocking plan_0068
- Molecule epic completion needs proper documentation

## üöÄ Next Steps Preparation

Documentation update tasks ready to proceed:
1. **update_claude_md**: Update epic statuses and g counter
2. **update_changelog**: Add missing entries for g=191-197
3. **update_aiconfig_patterns**: Add 4 cookbook recipes and fix g counter
4. **relocate_toilet_data**: Move export.geojson to data/toilets.geojson (critical blocker)
5. **update_readme_files**: Fix Frontend UI status and remove bug reference

## üîç POST-FLIGHT VALIDATOR VERIFICATION

**Validator**: role_validator  
**Validation Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Verdict**: DONE ‚úÖ

### Validation Findings:
1. **G Counter Discrepancy**: CONFIRMED
   - CLAUDE.md: g=123 (line 344)
   - aiconfig.json: g=182 (line 160)
   - changelog.md: g=197 (line 17)
   - 74 events behind in CLAUDE.md

2. **File Path Issues**: CONFIRMED (with minor variance)
   - Found 8 files with "docs/export.geojson" references (vs claimed 10)
   - export.geojson EXISTS in docs/ directory
   - Needs relocation to data/toilets.geojson

3. **Frontend UI Epic Status**: CONFIRMED
   - CLAUDE.md shows "atomic components complete, organisms pending"
   - Missing documentation that molecules are also complete (per changelog g=191)

4. **Documentation References**: NEEDS CORRECTION
   - Pre-flight listed non-existent spec files
   - Actual files are in docs/explanations/ directory

### Validator Notes:
- Audit findings are substantively accurate
- Documentation drift is significant and needs immediate attention
- Critical blocker (export.geojson location) correctly identified
- Task execution was thorough and produced actionable findings
