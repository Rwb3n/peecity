**Plan**: `plans/plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`
**Task**: `update_aiconfig_patterns`
**Type**: IMPLEMENTATION
**TDD Phase**: N/A (Configuration update)
**Status**: PRE-FLIGHT
**Date**: 2025-07-12T16:28:30.993Z

## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `aiconfig.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, cookbook recipes

**Parent Plan Task**: `update_aiconfig_patterns` from `plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A (Configuration task)

**Cookbook Patterns**: New patterns to be added to validated_patterns section

## 🎯 Objective

Update aiconfig.json with new validated patterns: v2 migration patterns, service-oriented architecture patterns from recent implementations, updated test coverage targets based on achieved percentages, new cookbook recipe references. Most critically, update g counter from 182 to 200 to align with changelog.

## 📝 Context

The audit revealed aiconfig.json is significantly outdated:
- Shows g=182 while changelog shows g=200 (18 events behind)
- Missing 4 new cookbook recipes identified in audit
- Missing validated patterns from v2 migration work
- Missing service architecture patterns from recent implementations
- Test coverage targets may need updating based on achieved 99%+ coverage

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Update g counter from 182 to 200 (line 160)
2. Add 4 new cookbook recipe references (safe_migration_patterns, react_hook_form, api_testing, react_testing)
3. Add v2 migration patterns to validated_patterns section
4. Add service-oriented architecture patterns
5. Update test coverage targets if needed
6. Ensure JSON remains valid

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Pre-flight findings:**
- aiconfig.json line 160: "g": 182
- Cookbook patterns section exists at lines 130-135
- validated_patterns section contains various project patterns
- Critical to maintain JSON validity

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Updated g counter from 182 to 200 (line 185)
- Added 4 new cookbook recipes to cookbook_integration section:
  - safe_migration_patterns (feature flag-based migration)
  - react_hook_form (z.coerce patterns)
  - api_testing (critical testing best practices)
  - react_testing (debugging patterns from saga)
- Added v2_migration_patterns section with feature flag strategy and safety gates
- Added service_oriented_architecture section with core services and principles
- Added debugging_patterns section capturing recent learnings
- Validated JSON syntax remains correct

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `aiconfig.json` | config | Updated with patterns and g counter |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - audit_documentation_state completed
**External Dependencies Available**: File system access confirmed

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task executed exactly as planned with all objectives achieved

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** All updates completed successfully
**Details:** 
- ✅ Updated g counter from 182 to 200 (synchronized with changelog)
- ✅ Added 4 new cookbook recipes to cookbook_integration section
- ✅ Added v2_migration_patterns with 7 key migration strategies
- ✅ Added service_oriented_architecture with 8 core services and principles
- ✅ Added debugging_patterns capturing recent learnings
- ✅ Validated JSON syntax remains correct (python -m json.tool passed)
- ✅ All sections properly formatted and integrated

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A (Configuration file)
**Canonical Documentation**: aiconfig.json is single source of truth

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE  
**Global event counter (g):** 200 (synchronized across all files)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

This update has:
- ✅ Synchronized g counter across all project files (CLAUDE.md, changelog, aiconfig)
- ✅ Documented new patterns for future development teams
- ✅ Added critical cookbook recipe references
- ✅ Captured v2 migration learnings and service architecture patterns

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- aiconfig.json now reflects current project state through g=200
- New patterns provide guidance for future migrations and architecture decisions
- Ready to proceed with remaining documentation updates
