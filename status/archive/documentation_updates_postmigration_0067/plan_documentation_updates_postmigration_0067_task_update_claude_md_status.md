**Plan**: `plans/plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`
**Task**: `update_claude_md`
**Type**: IMPLEMENTATION
**TDD Phase**: N/A (Documentation update)
**Status**: PRE-FLIGHT

## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `CLAUDE.md`, `changelog.md`, `aiconfig.json`

**Parent Plan Task**: `update_claude_md` from `plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A (Documentation task)

**Cookbook Patterns**: New patterns from completed epics to be documented

## 🎯 Objective

Update CLAUDE.md to reflect current project state: Mark completed epics (ingest, suggest, seo, monitor, metrics) as COMPLETE with coverage percentages, update current implementation status for frontend UI, add new service patterns and v2 API information, update development commands section, and fix g counter discrepancy.

## 📝 Context

The audit revealed CLAUDE.md is significantly outdated:
- Shows g=123 when it should be 197 (74 events behind)
- Missing epic completion statuses (5 epics marked complete in changelog)
- Frontend UI status doesn't reflect completed molecules
- Missing v2 API migration information
- Missing new service patterns from recent implementations

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Update g counter from 123 to 197 (line 344)
2. Mark completed epics as COMPLETE with coverage percentages
3. Update Frontend UI status to show molecules complete
4. Add v2 API migration information and feature flag patterns
5. Add new service patterns (TieredValidationService, MonitorService, etc.)
6. Update file location reference (export.geojson → data/toilets.geojson)
7. Add notes about recent debugging saga and safe migration patterns

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Pre-flight findings from audit:**
- CLAUDE.md line 344: Current g counter: 123
- Frontend UI section shows "atomic components complete" but molecules also done
- Missing documentation of v2 migration patterns
- Missing service-oriented architecture updates
- File now correctly located at data/toilets.geojson

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Updated g counter from 123 to 197 (line 345)
- Updated Frontend UI epic status to reflect completed molecules (lines 254 & 335)
- Added comprehensive API v2 Migration & Feature Flags section
- Added Safe Migration Patterns subsection documenting 5-gate safety process
- Added Recent Debugging Patterns subsection (g=191-197 work)
- Added SuggestPayloadTransformer to Core Services list
- Added 3 new cookbook recipes to Important Files section
- Verified file location already correct (data/toilets.geojson)
