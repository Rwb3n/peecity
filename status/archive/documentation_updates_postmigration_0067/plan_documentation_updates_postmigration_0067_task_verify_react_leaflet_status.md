## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `package.json`, plan_0068 requirements

**Parent Plan Task**: `verify_react_leaflet` from `plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A (Package verification task)

**Cookbook Patterns**: N/A

## 🎯 Objective

Check package.json for react-leaflet and leaflet dependencies. If missing, create task to add them with correct versions compatible with Next.js 15.x. Document installation in setup instructions. This blocks plan_0068 MapView implementation.

## 📝 Context

Plan_0068 requires MapView organism implementation using React-Leaflet for map functionality. The initial audit suggested checking if these dependencies are installed. This verification ensures plan_0068 can proceed with MapView development, as missing dependencies would block the implementation.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Check package.json for react-leaflet dependency
2. Check package.json for leaflet dependency  
3. Check package.json for @types/leaflet dependency
4. Verify versions are compatible with Next.js 15.x
5. If missing, document installation requirements
6. Confirm plan_0068 can proceed or identify blockers

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Pre-flight findings:**
- Plan_0068 explicitly depends on React-Leaflet for MapView
- Initial audit suggested this needed verification
- MapView cannot be implemented without these dependencies
- Compatible versions are critical for Next.js 15.x

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Checked package.json for react-leaflet dependency (✅ FOUND: "react-leaflet": "^4.2.1")
- Checked package.json for leaflet dependency (✅ FOUND: "leaflet": "^1.9.4")
- Checked package.json for @types/leaflet dependency (✅ FOUND: "@types/leaflet": "^1.9.0")
- Verified Next.js version compatibility (✅ COMPATIBLE: "next": "^15.0.0")
- Discovered bonus dependency: react-leaflet-markercluster "^4.2.1" (needed for clustering)
- Confirmed all versions are current and compatible

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| No files modified | N/A | All dependencies already installed |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - No direct dependencies for this verification
**External Dependencies Available**: File system access confirmed

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Better than expected - all dependencies already installed with current versions

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** All required dependencies confirmed present and compatible
**Details:** 
- ✅ react-leaflet v4.2.1 installed and compatible with Next.js 15.x
- ✅ leaflet v1.9.4 installed (current stable version)
- ✅ @types/leaflet v1.9.0 installed (TypeScript support)
- ✅ react-leaflet-markercluster v4.2.1 installed (bonus - needed for clustering)
- ✅ Next.js v15.0.0 confirmed compatible with React-Leaflet v4.x
- ✅ No installation required - plan_0068 can proceed immediately

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A (Verification task)
**Canonical Documentation**: Dependencies confirmed in package.json

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE  
**Global event counter (g):** 200 (from aiconfig update)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

This verification has:
- ✅ Confirmed plan_0068 can proceed with MapView implementation immediately
- ✅ Verified all required dependencies are installed with current versions
- ✅ Confirmed Next.js 15.x compatibility with React-Leaflet 4.2.1
- ✅ Discovered react-leaflet-markercluster is already available for advanced features

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- Plan_0068 is UNBLOCKED - all dependencies ready
- MapView implementation can proceed with react-leaflet v4.2.1
- Marker clustering functionality already available
- No installation or setup tasks needed
