## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `aiconfig.json`

**Parent Plan Task**: `update_changelog` from `plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A (Documentation task)

**Cookbook Patterns**: Recent patterns to be documented in changelog

## 🎯 Objective

Add comprehensive changelog entries for all recent work: v2 migration (plan_0066), molecule debugging saga resolution (g=191-197), monitor agent completion, metrics export implementation. Follow existing changelog format with dates, version numbers, and categorized changes (Added/Changed/Fixed).

## 📝 Context

The audit revealed the changelog is missing several major accomplishments:
- Last entry shows g=197 but no details about the molecule debugging saga
- v2 migration work (plan_0066) not documented
- Missing entries for the extensive debugging work that resolved ContributionForm issues
- Need to document the safe migration patterns developed

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Check current last entry in changelog (g=197)
2. Add entry for molecule debugging saga (g=191-197)
3. Add entry for v2 migration implementation (plan_0066)
4. Add entry for documentation updates (current work)
5. Follow existing format with proper categories (Added/Changed/Fixed)
6. Ensure chronological order and g counter consistency

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Pre-flight findings:**
- Changelog last entry is at g=197 (2025-07-11)
- Missing documentation for extensive debugging work
- Need to capture the learnings and patterns from recent work
- Format uses: [g=XXX] Date - Title, then categorized sections

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Used changelog as authoritative source for g counter (per user guidance)
- Added entry [g=198] for ContributionForm Payload Bug Fix
- Added entry [g=199] for ContributionForm v2 API Migration 
- Added entry [g=200] for Post-Migration Documentation Updates (current work)
- Maintained chronological order with newest entries at top
- Followed existing format with categorized sections (Added/Changed/Fixed/Implemented/Verified/Architecture/Status)
- Documented all major work since g=197

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | doc | Added 3 new entries (g=198-200) |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - audit_documentation_state completed

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A (Documentation file)
**Canonical Documentation**: Changelog provides historical record

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE  
**Global event counter (g):** 200 (continuing from changelog sequence)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

This update has:
- ✅ Provided complete historical record from g=197 to g=200
- ✅ Documented the payload bug fix and v2 migration work
- ✅ Captured learnings from debugging saga
