## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: Codebase files, grep search results

**Parent Plan Task**: `verify_code_references` from `plan_documentation_updates_postmigration_0067.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A (Search and verification task)

**Cookbook Patterns**: N/A

## 🎯 Objective

After moving export.geojson, grep entire codebase for any hardcoded references to the old location (docs/export.geojson). Update all found references to new location (data/toilets.geojson). Check: React components, API routes, tests, scripts, documentation to prevent runtime errors from broken file paths.

## 📝 Context

During the relocate_toilet_data task, export.geojson was moved from docs/ to data/toilets.geojson. While 5 critical files were updated, there may be additional references in the codebase that could cause runtime errors if not updated. This verification ensures no references to the old path remain.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Search entire codebase for "docs/export.geojson" references
2. Search for "export.geojson" references that might be relative paths
3. Check React components for data loading paths
4. Check API routes for file access paths
5. Check tests for mock data paths
6. Check scripts for file processing paths
7. Update any remaining references to data/toilets.geojson
8. Verify no broken file paths remain

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Pre-flight findings:**
- relocate_toilet_data task already updated 5 critical files
- Need to verify no additional references exist
- Critical to prevent runtime errors from broken paths
- Must check both absolute and relative path references

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Searched entire codebase for "docs/export.geojson" references (found 7 files)
- Verified all remaining references are in documentation/status files (historical records)
- Searched src/ directory for "export.geojson" references (found 0 files)
- Searched tests/ directory for "export.geojson" references (found 0 files)  
- Searched scripts/ directory for "export.geojson" references (found 0 files)
- Verified all source code correctly uses "data/toilets.geojson" (found 5 correct references)
- Searched JSON config files for old references (found 0 files)
- Verified no import/require statements reference old path

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| No files modified | N/A | No actionable references found to update |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - relocate_toilet_data completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: grep/search tools confirmed working

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed successfully - verification confirmed no action needed

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** All verifications completed successfully
**Details:** 
- ✅ Comprehensive search completed across entire codebase
- ✅ No actionable code references to old path found
- ✅ All source code correctly references data/toilets.geojson (5 confirmed)
- ✅ All remaining "docs/export.geojson" references are in documentation (appropriate)
- ✅ No import/require statements use old path
- ✅ No configuration files reference old path
- ✅ relocate_toilet_data task was thorough and complete

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A (Verification task)
**Canonical Documentation**: All paths confirmed to point to correct location

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE  
**Global event counter (g):** 200 (from aiconfig update)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

This verification has:
- ✅ Confirmed no runtime errors will occur from broken file paths
- ✅ Verified all code references use correct data/toilets.geojson path
- ✅ Ensured components can access toilet data correctly
- ✅ Completed the file relocation process safely

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- File relocation verification complete
- No code changes needed - all references are correct
- Safe to proceed with remaining documentation tasks
