## üìö Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/cookbook/recipe_docs_structure.md - Documentation structure patterns

**Parent Plan Task**: `12` - Author ADR-005 Prometheus Native Histograms adoption

**Testing Tools**: Jest, gray-matter, AJV, scaffolding CLI

**Cookbook Patterns**: TDD Green phase implementation, ADR authoring

## üéØ Objective

Create a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record (ADR-005) documenting the rationale for adopting Prometheus native histograms for validation performance monitoring, making all 9 failing ADR tests pass and completing the TDD Green phase for all new content files.

## üìù Context

This task represents the final content file implementation in the TDD Green phase, following the successful completion of the Prometheus exporter recipe and k6 load-testing guide. The goal is to create a production-ready ADR that provides clear decision rationale, implementation plan, and consequences analysis for native histogram adoption.

## ü™ú Task Steps Summary

1. **Test Requirements Analysis**: Examined failing tests to understand required ADR sections and content
2. **Scaffolding Generation**: Used scaffold-doc.js CLI to generate initial ADR structure
3. **Content Development**: Created comprehensive ADR with context, decision rationale, consequences, and implementation plan
4. **Technical Context**: Integrated validation performance monitoring context and tier-based system requirements
5. **Schema Compliance**: Fixed front-matter validation issues and ensured full compliance
6. **Test Validation**: Verified all 9 ADR tests pass and complete TDD Green phase

## üß† Knowledge Capture

- **ADR Structure**: Comprehensive understanding of Architecture Decision Record format and requirements
- **Native Histograms**: Deep technical knowledge of Prometheus native histogram benefits and implementation
- **Validation Context**: Integration with tier-based validation system and performance monitoring
- **Implementation Planning**: Multi-phase rollout strategy with backward compatibility and dashboard updates
- **Alternative Analysis**: Thorough evaluation of alternative approaches and rejection rationale

## üõ† Actions Taken

- Generated initial ADR structure using scaffold-doc.js CLI with proper front-matter
- Created comprehensive ADR covering all required sections: Context, Decision, Consequences, Implementation, Alternatives
- Integrated validation performance monitoring context and tier-based system requirements
- Provided detailed implementation plan with phase-by-phase rollout strategy
- Fixed front-matter validation issues (status enum compliance, required tags)
- Verified all 9 ADR tests pass and complete TDD Green phase (26/26 tests passing)
- Updated plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt Task 12 status to DONE

## üîó Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 9 (stub tests) completed successfully with all failing tests established
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.x, scaffolding CLI, Prometheus native histogram patterns operational

## üìã Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: Medium - Due to technical complexity of native histogram concepts and implementation planning
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Exceeded expectations - Created comprehensive ADR with detailed technical analysis, implementation strategy, and thorough alternative evaluation.

## ‚úÖ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions validated - ADR comprehensive, tests passing, schema compliance confirmed
**Details:** ADR tests: 9/9 passed (TDD Green phase complete). Full test suite: 26/26 tests passing (100% TDD Green phase completion). Schema validation: All front-matter fields compliant. Integration tests: Author consistency, tag requirements, and date validation all pass.

## üîó Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - ADR includes comprehensive cross-references to validation performance monitoring, related ADRs, and technical context
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - ADR references appropriate performance monitoring runbooks, cookbook recipes, and architecture documentation

## üèÅ Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 111 (maintained current state)

## üåç Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: 
- **Native Histogram Strategy**: Comprehensive decision framework for Prometheus native histogram adoption
- **TDD Completion**: All 26 tests passing - complete TDD Green phase for new content files
