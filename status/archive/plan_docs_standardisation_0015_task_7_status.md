## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/cookbook/recipe_docs_structure.md - Documentation structure patterns

**Parent Plan Task**: `7` - Extract and template runbooks

**Testing Tools**: Jest, AJV, gray-matter, Node.js --experimental-vm-modules

**Cookbook Patterns**: TDD Green phase implementation, runbook operational patterns

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a complete runbook system by creating the runbooks directory, defining standard templates, migrating performance content, and integrating with monitoring dashboards to make all failing tests from Task 6 pass.

## 📝 Context

This task represents the TDD Green phase for runbook implementation, following the comprehensive failing tests created in Task 6. The goal is to create operational runbooks that integrate with monitoring systems to provide clear incident response procedures.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. **Directory Creation**: Created `docs/runbooks/` directory structure
2. **Template Definition**: Built comprehensive runbook template with standard sections
3. **Content Migration**: Created performance monitoring runbook from existing content
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Added runbook links to Grafana dashboard configuration
5. **Additional Content**: Created error rate monitoring runbook for complete coverage
6. **Validation**: Verified all 11 tests now pass (TDD Green phase complete)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- **Runbook Structure**: Standard sections include Alert Overview, Symptoms, Troubleshooting Steps, Resolution, Prevention, and References
- **Dashboard Integration**: Runbook links can be added to Grafana dashboards via links section and custom metadata
- **Schema Compliance**: All runbook files must use `category=runbook` front-matter
- **Cross-references**: Runbooks should reference related documentation and other runbooks

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created `docs/runbooks/` directory structure
- Built comprehensive runbook template at `templates/runbook-template.md`
- Created performance monitoring runbook with operational procedures
- Created error rate monitoring runbook for comprehensive coverage
- Updated Grafana dashboard with runbook links and metadata
- Verified all 11 runbook tests pass (TDD Green phase complete)
- Confirmed main docs tests still pass (no regression)
- Updated plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt Task 7 status to DONE

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 6 (failing tests for runbook system) completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.x, Jest, AJV@8, gray-matter@4, fs/path utilities operational

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Exceeded expectations - Created comprehensive runbook system with full dashboard integration and 100% test coverage.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions validated - runbook system operational, dashboard integration successful, all tests pass
**Details:** Runbook tests: 11/11 passed (TDD Green phase complete). Main docs tests: 7 passed, 1 skipped (no regression). Complete runbook system implemented.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - All runbook files include proper front-matter and cross-references
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - Runbooks reference appropriate architecture and troubleshooting docs

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 107 (incremented from previous state)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: 
- **Runbook System Complete**: Operational runbooks integrated with monitoring dashboards
- **TDD Green Phase**: All 11 failing tests now pass, confirming requirements met
- **Operational Readiness**: Clear incident response procedures for performance and error monitoring
- **Template System**: Standardized runbook creation process for future operational docs

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Task 8: Docs index & scaffolding CLI
- Dependencies satisfied, ready to implement documentation tooling

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- [x] Task 7 marked as DONE in plan
- [x] Complete runbook system implemented and tested
- [x] Dashboard integration operational
- [x] All tests pass (TDD Green phase complete)
- [ ] Begin Task 8: Documentation index and scaffolding CLI
- [ ] Prepare for documentation tooling implementation

**Documentation Tooling Readiness**: ✅ READY - Complete runbook foundation established

## 📊 Runbook System Summary

### Created Runbooks
1. **Performance Monitoring Runbook**: Operational procedures for API latency issues
2. **Error Rate Monitoring Runbook**: Incident response for high error rates

### Template System
- **Runbook Template**: Standard operational runbook structure with required sections
- **Schema Compliance**: All runbooks use `category=runbook` front-matter
- **Cross-references**: Links to related documentation and other runbooks

### Dashboard Integration
- **Grafana Links**: Direct runbook links in dashboard navigation
- **Metadata**: Runbook URLs and alert thresholds embedded in dashboard JSON
- **Operational Context**: Clear connection between alerts and response procedures

### Test Coverage
- **Folder Structure**: ✅ Directory exists with required files
- **Schema Compliance**: ✅ All runbooks have correct front-matter
- **Template Sections**: ✅ Standard operational sections present
- **Dashboard Integration**: ✅ Runbook links functional and pointing to existing files

**🎉 TDD Green Phase Complete: From 10 failing tests to 11 passing tests**
