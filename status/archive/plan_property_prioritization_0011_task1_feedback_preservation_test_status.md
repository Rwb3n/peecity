**Plan**: `plans/plan_property_prioritization_0011.txt`
**Task**: `feedback_preservation_test`
**Type**: TEST_CREATION
**TDD Phase**: Red
**Status**: PENDING
**Date**: 2025-07-06T20:29:02.992Z

## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: 
- `feedback.txt` - Property prioritization framework
- `data/osm_properties_analysis.json` - 120 property frequency data
- `docs/reference/api/suggest-api.md` - Current API documentation

**Parent Plan Task**: `feedback_preservation_test` from plan_property_prioritization_0011.txt

**Testing Tools**: Jest, fs module

**Cookbook Patterns**: Will reference `docs/cookbook/recipe_tiered_validation.md` once created

## 🎯 Objective

Create a failing test that validates the structure and completeness of a property tier configuration file (suggestPropertyTiers.json), establishing the RED phase for implementing the 4-tier property prioritization system.

## 📝 Context

Based on comprehensive feedback analysis (feedback.txt), we need to implement a tier system for the 120 OSM properties:
- **Core (8)**: Essential v1 properties always validated
- **High-frequency (16)**: Common properties for v2 defaults
- **Optional (17)**: Advanced user options
- **Specialized (79)**: Edge cases accepted but not surfaced

This test will ensure the configuration file exists and properly categorizes all 120 properties with required metadata.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create test file `tests/config/property_tiers_test.js`
2. Implement checks for configuration file existence
3. Validate all 120 properties are present
4. Verify required fields (tier, frequency, validationType)
5. Check tier distribution matches expected counts
6. Run test to confirm RED phase (failure)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- **Test Structure**: Created comprehensive test suite with 13 test cases covering configuration structure, property coverage, tier distribution, core properties validation, and tier definitions
- **Validation Approach**: Test validates both structure (file existence, JSON validity) and content (120 properties, tier distribution counts, required fields)
- **Expected Tier Distribution**: Core (8), High-frequency (16), Optional (17), Specialized (79) - Total 120 properties
- **Core Properties Identified**: lat, lng, @id, amenity, wheelchair, access, opening_hours, fee - Essential v1 properties
- **Required Property Fields**: Each property must have tier, frequency, and validationType fields

## 🛠 Actions Taken

1. Created test file `tests/config/property_tiers_test.js` with comprehensive validation logic
2. Implemented test cases covering:
   - Configuration file existence and JSON validity
   - Top-level structure validation (version, generated_at, source, tiers, properties)
   - All 120 OSM properties coverage check
   - Required fields validation for each property
   - Exact tier distribution counts (8+16+17+79=120)
   - Core properties inclusion validation
   - Tier definition structure validation
3. Ran test to confirm RED phase - all 13 tests failing as expected
4. Test failure confirms suggestPropertyTiers.json doesn't exist yet

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - No dependencies for TEST_CREATION phase
**External Dependencies Available**: 
- Jest ✓ (existing test infrastructure)
- fs module ✓ (Node.js built-in)
- data/osm_properties_analysis.json ✓ (created during API documentation)

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task proceeded exactly as predicted. Test created successfully and fails in RED phase as expected.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions remain valid - OSM analysis data exists, Jest infrastructure works correctly
**Details:** Test created and executed. All 13 tests fail as expected for RED phase:
- Configuration file doesn't exist (ENOENT error)
- All subsequent tests fail due to undefined tierConfig
- Failure confirms we're in proper RED phase of TDD cycle

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: ✅ Verified - Test file contains proper artifact annotation pointing to docs/reference/property-prioritization.md#tier-system
**Canonical Documentation**: ✅ References added to feedback.txt, osm_properties_analysis.json, and future property-prioritization.md

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 51

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

- **RED Phase Established**: Failing test provides clear target for implementation phase
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation ensures robust configuration structure
- **Foundation Set**: Test defines exact requirements for property tier system implementation

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- [ ] Task 2 (feedback_preservation_impl) ready to execute
- [ ] Need to create suggestPropertyTiers.json to make tests pass
- [ ] Generate configuration from osm_properties_analysis.json data
- [ ] Create supporting documentation files
- [ ] Achieve GREEN phase by passing all 13 tests
