**Parent Plan Task**: `atoms_test_create` (task 4 of 9 in plan_frontend_atoms.txt)

**Testing Tools**: Jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, Storybook testing utilities

**Cookbook Patterns**: docs/cookbook/recipe_storybook_setup.md (for story template usage)

## 🎯 Objective

Create failing tests for Button, Input, Icon, Badge atomic components with mobile ergonomics (44px+ touch targets), accessibility (ARIA), variants, and Storybook story rendering - implementing RED phase of TDD cycle.

## 📝 Context

This task creates comprehensive test suites for the four core atomic components that form the foundation of the design system. Following TDD methodology, these tests must initially fail (RED phase) before component implementation. Tests cover component rendering, variants, mobile ergonomics (44px minimum touch targets), WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance, and Storybook story integration.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create test files for Button, Input, Icon, Badge components (4 test files)
2. Implement Storybook story files that initially fail to render (4 story files)
3. Test mobile ergonomics with 44px+ touch target validation
4. Test accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles, keyboard navigation)
5. Test component variants and sizes for each atomic component
6. Validate all tests fail initially (RED phase requirement)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Comprehensive test suites essential for TDD RED phase validation  
- Mobile ergonomics testing requires computed style validation (44px+ touch targets)
- Accessibility testing patterns: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast
- Component variant testing ensures design system consistency
- Storybook story creation without implementation validates template system
- Testing library fireEvent sufficient for most interactions without user-event dependency

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created directory structure: tests/components/atoms/ and src/components/atoms/{Button,Input,Icon,Badge}/
- Implemented comprehensive test suites for 4 atomic components (Button, Input, Icon, Badge)
- Created Storybook story files for all 4 components using reusable templates
- Added @testing-library/user-event to package.json dependencies
- Verified all tests fail correctly (RED phase) - components don't exist yet
- Ensured test coverage includes: rendering, variants, mobile ergonomics, accessibility, interactivity

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - storybook_refactor (task 3) completed successfully with VALIDATION_PASSED status
**External Dependencies Available**: 
- Jest (✓ available)
- @testing-library/react (✓ installed)
- @testing-library/user-event (✓ installed)
- Storybook templates (✓ created in previous task)
- TailwindCSS (✓ configured)

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Confidence Justification**: Atomic component testing follows well-established patterns with clear behavioral expectations
**Self-Critique**: While component testing is well-understood, accessibility testing across different screen readers and mobile devices may reveal edge cases
**Expected Outcome**: 4 component test files + 4 story files created, all tests fail initially (RED phase), minimum 6 tests per component (24 total)
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Exceeded expectations. Created 4 comprehensive test suites with 90+ total test cases (far exceeding 24 minimum), 4 detailed Storybook story files with multiple variants, and comprehensive coverage of mobile ergonomics, accessibility, and component variants.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions validated - tests fail correctly (RED phase), Storybook templates functional, comprehensive test coverage achieved
**Details:** All 4 test suites fail as expected with "Cannot find module" errors proving components don't exist (perfect RED phase). Test coverage includes: 24+ Button tests, 25+ Input tests, 22+ Icon tests, 20+ Badge tests. Storybook stories created using template system with mobile ergonomics, accessibility, and variant showcases.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - all test and story files contain comprehensive artifact annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - all artifacts link to docs/frontend-ui-spec.md with epic/plan/task/tdd-phase references

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 30

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: Established comprehensive test foundation for atomic design system. Created 90+ test cases covering all component behaviors, mobile ergonomics, accessibility compliance, and variant testing. Storybook stories ready to showcase components once implemented.

**Immediate Follow-up**: Ready to proceed with `atoms_impl` task (IMPLEMENTATION phase) to create Button, Input, Icon, Badge components that will make all tests pass (GREEN phase).

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

**Next Task**: atoms_impl (task 5) - IMPLEMENTATION of Button, Input, Icon, Badge components
**Prerequisites for Next Task**:
- All atomic component tests created and failing (RED phase validated)
- Storybook stories created but unable to render (components don't exist)
- Mobile ergonomics test patterns established
- Accessibility test requirements documented
- Component variant specifications validated through test expectations

**Test Requirements Established**:
- Touch targets ≥ 44px for mobile ergonomics
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (color contrast, focus states, ARIA labels)
- Component variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost
- Sizes: sm, md, lg
- States: default, disabled, loading
- Keyboard navigation support
