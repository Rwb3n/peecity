**Parent Plan Task**: `4` <!-- from plan_metrics_export_0013.txt -->

**Testing Tools**: Jest, Node.js test runner

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/cookbook/recipe_metrics_export.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Write comprehensive tests for GET /api/validation/summary endpoint that expects JSON statistics about validation operations including tier breakdowns, success rates, latency percentiles, time window queries, and error categorization.

## 📝 Context

Following successful completion of Task 3 (metrics endpoint refactoring), this task creates failing tests for a new validation summary API that will provide JSON-formatted statistics aggregated from the TieredValidationServiceWithMetrics.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Created test file structure with proper annotations ✅
2. Implemented test helper for making requests ✅
3. Wrote tests for endpoint availability and JSON format ✅
4. Added tests for tier breakdown statistics ✅
5. Created tests for latency percentile calculations ✅
6. Implemented time window query parameter tests ✅
7. Added error categorization tests ✅
8. Included performance requirement tests ✅
9. Added edge case handling tests ✅

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Test structure mirrors expected API response format
- Time window validation includes parameter format and duration calculations
- Percentile ordering validation ensures statistical correctness
- Performance tests include both single request and concurrent load scenarios
- Edge cases cover empty metrics and disabled state
- All tests use consistent mock request pattern from api-test-helper

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created `tests/api/validation_summary_test.js` with 19 comprehensive test cases
- Structured tests into logical groups:
  - Endpoint availability and response format (2 tests)
  - Tier breakdowns (2 tests)
  - Latency percentiles (2 tests)
  - Time window queries (5 tests)
  - Error categorization (2 tests)
  - Summary statistics (2 tests)
  - Performance requirements (2 tests)
  - Edge cases (2 tests)
- Used consistent error handling pattern for missing route
- Included proper TDD annotations

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/api/validation_summary_test.js` | test | Created - 19 failing tests for summary API |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 3 is DONE
**External Dependencies Available**: Yes - Jest and test helpers available

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed exactly as expected. All tests fail with appropriate error messages.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** Tests correctly expect endpoint that doesn't exist
**Details:** 
- All 19 tests fail with "Validation summary route not available"
- Module not found error confirms endpoint doesn't exist
- Test structure validates all acceptance criteria
- Tests are comprehensive and ready for implementation phase

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - test file contains @artifact, @task, and @tdd-phase annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Points to docs/cookbook/recipe_metrics_export.md

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 87

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Task 4 successfully completed with 19 comprehensive failing tests that cover:
- JSON response structure validation ✅
- Tier-specific statistics and success rates ✅
- Latency percentile calculations (p50/p95/p99) ✅
- Time window queries (1h/24h/7d/all) ✅
- Error categorization by type and tier ✅
- Performance requirements (< 10ms response) ✅
- Edge cases and error handling ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

Ready to proceed with Task 5: Implement the validation summary API endpoint to make all these tests pass (GREEN phase).
