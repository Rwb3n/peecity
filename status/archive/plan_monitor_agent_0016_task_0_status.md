## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/architecture-spec.md#monitor-agent, docs/engineering-spec.md#testing-standards

**Parent Plan Task**: `0` from plan_monitor_agent_0016.txt - "Failing tests for scheduled run & Discord summary"

**Testing Tools**: Jest, nock (HTTP mocking), node-cron (mocked), fake timers

**Cookbook Patterns**: docs/cookbook/recipe_*.md - Agent testing patterns from ingest-agent and suggest-agent

## 🎯 Objective

Write comprehensive failing tests for MonitorService covering scheduled execution, ingest integration, Discord webhooks, data diff analysis, suggestion log parsing, metrics collection, and summary generation.

## 📝 Context

Implementing TDD Red phase for monitor-agent epic. MonitorService must run weekly via GitHub Actions, trigger ingest refresh, analyze metrics, and post Discord summaries. This task establishes comprehensive test coverage before implementation begins.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Install node-cron@3.0.2 dependency as specified in plan
2. Create comprehensive test suite covering all MonitorService functionality
3. Mock node-cron to avoid ES module compatibility issues
4. Implement timer mocking for scheduled execution testing
5. Add HTTP mocking for Discord webhook and metrics API calls
6. Verify all tests fail with expected "Cannot find module" errors
7. Update Jest configuration for node-cron compatibility

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- node-cron has ES module compatibility issues in Jest - requires mocking
- Timer mocking with jest.useFakeTimers() essential for cron testing
- HTTP mocking with nock allows comprehensive webhook testing
- Comprehensive test coverage (15 tests) ensures robust implementation
- Test structure follows established agent testing patterns

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Added node-cron@3.0.2 to package.json dependencies
- Created tests/agents/monitor_agent_test.js with 15 comprehensive test cases
- Implemented node-cron mocking to avoid ES module issues
- Added timer mocking for scheduled execution testing
- Created HTTP mocks for Discord webhook and metrics API testing
- Added file system mocks for data diff and log analysis testing
- Updated Jest configuration with transformIgnorePatterns (attempted)
- Verified all tests fail with expected "Cannot find module" errors

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `package.json` | config | Added node-cron@3.0.2 dependency |
| `tests/agents/monitor_agent_test.js` | test | Created comprehensive test suite with 15 test cases |
| `jest.config.js` | config | Updated with transformIgnorePatterns (partial fix) |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - No task dependencies for Task 0
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.x, Jest 29.x, nock 13.x, node-cron 3.0.2 (newly installed)

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High - "Simulated cron & webhook mocking is straightforward in Jest"
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Largely as expected with one complication - node-cron ES module compatibility required mocking workaround rather than direct import

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions valid - Jest mocking capabilities confirmed, comprehensive test coverage achieved
**Details:** All 15 tests properly fail with expected "Cannot find module '../../src/services/MonitorService'" errors. Test structure covers all required functionality areas from plan success criteria.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - test file contains proper @doc refs annotation
**Canonical Documentation**: Added @doc refs docs/architecture-spec.md#monitor-agent annotation

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED  
**Global event counter (g):** 117 (incremented from 116)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

TDD Red phase complete with comprehensive test coverage establishing clear implementation requirements. Next task (Task 1) will implement MonitorService to make all tests pass (Green phase). Test structure provides robust foundation for monitor-agent development.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- MonitorService implementation must cover all 15 test cases
- Service should follow established patterns from IngestService and other services
- GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/monitor.yml) needs creation
- Integration with existing IngestService and metrics APIs required
- Discord webhook utility function needs implementation
