## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/cookbook/recipe_docs_structure.md - Documentation structure patterns

**Parent Plan Task**: `6` - Failing tests for runbook folder & template

**Testing Tools**: Jest, AJV, gray-matter, Node.js --experimental-vm-modules, fs path utilities

**Cookbook Patterns**: TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle, test-first development

## 🎯 Objective

Create comprehensive failing tests for runbook integration, asserting that files in `docs/runbooks/` have correct `category=runbook` front-matter and that dashboard JSONs contain links to runbooks, establishing the TDD Red phase for runbook implementation.

## 📝 Context

This task initiates the runbook implementation phase following the completion of the 3-phase documentation standardization. Runbooks are operational guides referenced from monitoring dashboards, requiring integration testing to ensure proper linking and metadata compliance.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. **Research**: Analyzed existing runbook references in metrics export cookbook
2. **Schema Analysis**: Verified "runbook" category exists in front-matter schema
3. **Dashboard Analysis**: Examined Grafana dashboard template for runbook integration points
4. **Test Design**: Created comprehensive test suite covering folder structure, schema compliance, and dashboard integration
5. **TDD Red Verification**: Confirmed all tests fail as expected for proper TDD cycle

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- **Runbook Integration Points**: Grafana dashboard template at `templates/grafana-citypee-validation.json`
- **Schema Compliance**: "runbook" category already exists in `docs_frontmatter_schema.json`
- **Test Structure**: Comprehensive test suite covering 4 main areas: folder structure, schema compliance, dashboard integration, and template definition
- **TDD Red Phase**: All 10 tests fail as expected, establishing clear implementation requirements

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created comprehensive test file `tests/docs/runbooks_test.js` with 11 test cases
- Verified Grafana dashboard template exists at `templates/grafana-citypee-validation.json`
- Confirmed "runbook" category exists in schema enum
- Analyzed existing runbook references in metrics export cookbook
- Executed tests to verify TDD Red phase (10 failed, 1 passed)
- Confirmed main docs tests still pass (no regression)
- Updated plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt Task 6 status to DONE

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified

| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/docs/runbooks_test.js` | test | Created comprehensive runbook integration tests |
| `plans/plan_docs_standardisation_0015.txt` | plan | Updated Task 6 status to DONE |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 5 (Phase 3 complete documentation migration) completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.x, Jest, AJV@8, gray-matter@4, fs/path utilities all operational

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Met expectations perfectly - Created comprehensive failing tests that clearly define implementation requirements for runbook integration.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All critical assumptions validated - schema includes runbook category, dashboard template exists, TDD Red phase established
**Details:** Runbook tests: 10 failed, 1 passed (as expected for TDD Red). Main docs tests: 7 passed, 1 skipped (no regression). Clear implementation requirements defined.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - Test file includes proper task annotation and TDD phase marker
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - Test references appropriate schema and dashboard files

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 106 (incremented from previous state)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

**Impact**: 
- **TDD Red Phase Complete**: Established clear requirements for runbook implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing for folder structure, schema compliance, dashboard integration, and template definition
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Clear path forward for Task 7 (runbook implementation)

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Task 7: Extract and template runbooks (TDD Green phase)
- Dependencies satisfied, ready to implement failing tests

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- [x] Task 6 marked as DONE in plan
- [x] Comprehensive failing tests created and verified
- [x] Main docs tests confirm no regression
- [x] TDD Red phase properly established
- [ ] Begin Task 7: Implement runbook folder, template, and dashboard integration
- [ ] Create docs/runbooks/ directory and migrate performance content

**Implementation Readiness**: ✅ READY - Clear test requirements established for runbook system

## 📋 Test Requirements Summary

### Required Implementations for Task 7:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Create `docs/runbooks/` directory
   - Migrate performance runbook as `performance-monitoring.md`

2. **Schema Compliance**:
   - All runbook files must have `category=runbook` front-matter
   - Must pass schema validation with required fields

3. **Template System**:
   - Create `templates/runbook-template.md`
   - Include standard sections: Alert Overview, Symptoms, Troubleshooting Steps, Resolution, Prevention, References

4. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Add `runbook_url` fields to Grafana dashboard
   - Link to actual runbook files in `docs/runbooks/`

**Test Status**: 10 failing tests ready for TDD Green phase implementation
