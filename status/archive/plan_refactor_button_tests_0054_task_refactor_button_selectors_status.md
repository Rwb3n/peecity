## üìö Appropriate References

**Issue**: `issues/issue_0052.txt`
**Diagnostic Tests**: `tests/diagnostics/molecule_regression_diag_test.tsx`
**Component**: `src/components/molecules/MarkerPopup/MarkerPopup.tsx`

## üéØ Objective

Fix brittle test selectors by using exact aria-label strings instead of regex patterns for the Report button.

## üìù Context

The MarkerPopup component tests were failing because the test was looking for a button with accessible name matching `/report issue/i`, but the button has an aria-label that overrides the visible text. The aria-label is the authoritative source for the accessible name.

## üõ† Actions Taken

1. **Restored original implementation**: 
   - Changed aria-label back to "Report an issue with this toilet"
   - Restored visible text to "Report issue"

2. **Updated test selectors**:
   - In `molecule_regression_diag_test.tsx`, changed the report button query from `{ name: /report issue/i }` to `{ name: 'Report an issue with this toilet' }` in two locations
   - Also updated the single-purpose diagnostic test file for consistency

3. **Used exact string matching**: Removed brittle regex patterns in favor of exact aria-label strings

## üèÅ Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 181

## üåç Impact & Next Steps

The test selectors have been refactored to use the exact aria-label strings, which removes ambiguity and aligns with ARIA standards. This should resolve the "button not found" test failures. The focus order tests will still fail but for the correct reasons - actual focus order issues rather than element selection problems.

Next step is validation to confirm the button selection tests now pass.

## ‚úÖ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Details:** The diagnostic test suite was executed. As expected, the test `DIAGNOSTIC: MarkerPopup Persistent Failures ‚Ä∫ should render action buttons` now **PASSES**. The selector refactoring was successful. The only remaining failures are the two known tests for keyboard navigation (focus order).
*   **Test Suites**: 1 failed, 1 total
*   **Tests**: 2 failed, 3 passed, 5 total
*   **Conclusion**: The button selector issue is officially resolved. The problem space has been successfully reduced to only the focus management issues.
