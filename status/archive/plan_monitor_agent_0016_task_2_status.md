## üìö Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/architecture-spec.md#monitor-agent, docs/cookbook/recipe_monitor_agent_patterns.md

**Parent Plan Task**: `2` from plan_monitor_agent_0016.txt - "Refactor for modular alert channels & metrics selection"

**Testing Tools**: Jest, TypeScript interfaces, service-oriented architecture patterns

**Cookbook Patterns**: docs/cookbook/recipe_monitor_agent_patterns.md - Monitor agent architectural patterns

## üéØ Objective

Refactor MonitorService to use pluggable alert channels and configurable metrics collection. Extract interfaces for AlertSender and MetricsCollector to enable future extensibility (Slack, email, additional metrics sources).

## üìù Context

Completing TDD Refactor phase for monitor-agent epic. Task 1 implemented the core functionality with Discord-specific and metrics-specific code. This task extracts interfaces to enable modular architecture for future extensions.

## ü™ú Task Steps Summary

1. Create AlertSender interface for pluggable alert channels
2. Create MetricsCollector interface for configurable metrics collection
3. Implement DiscordAlertSender as AlertSender implementation
4. Implement ValidationSummaryMetricsCollector and PrometheusMetricsCollector
5. Refactor MonitorService to use dependency injection with interfaces
6. Add configuration options for requestedMetrics, alertSenders, and metricsCollectors
7. Remove deprecated methods and maintain backward compatibility
8. Create comprehensive cookbook documentation
9. Verify all tests pass and code quality maintained

## üß† Knowledge Capture

- Interface segregation principle enables clean separation of concerns
- Dependency injection allows for easy testing and configuration
- Graceful degradation patterns ensure system resilience
- Configuration-driven behavior provides runtime flexibility
- Service-oriented architecture scales well with additional features
- Pluggable alert channels enable multi-channel notifications
- Configurable metrics collection supports different deployment environments

## üõ† Actions Taken

- Created AlertSender interface with sendAlert(), getChannelName(), and isConfigured() methods
- Created MetricsCollector interface with collectMetrics(), getSourceName(), and isAvailable() methods
- Implemented DiscordAlertSender as clean AlertSender implementation
- Implemented ValidationSummaryMetricsCollector and PrometheusMetricsCollector
- Refactored MonitorService constructor to accept alertSenders and metricsCollectors arrays
- Added requestedMetrics configuration for selective metrics collection
- Replaced sendDiscordNotification() with sendAlertNotifications() supporting multiple channels
- Replaced collectMetrics() with configurable collector-based approach
- Removed deprecated methods (collectFromValidationSummary, collectFromPrometheusMetrics, etc.)
- Created comprehensive cookbook documentation with implementation patterns
- Verified all 15 tests continue to pass after refactoring

## üîó Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - Task 1 (IMPLEMENTATION) completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: All existing dependencies maintained, no new external dependencies required

## üìã Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: Medium - "Abstracting alert channels adds modest complexity; risk of over-engineering mitigated by YAGNI review"
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Refactoring proceeded smoothly with clean interface design. No over-engineering - kept implementation simple and focused on immediate needs with extensibility points

## ‚úÖ Validation (2025-07-09T21:50Z)

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED

**Details:**
- Added required YAML front-matter to `docs/cookbook/recipe_monitor_agent_patterns.md`
- `tests/docs/docs_structure_test.js` now passes (1/1 tests)
- Monitor agent code tests continue to pass (15/15 tests)
- All success criteria met: docs compliance, code quality, and architectural requirements

### Fix Applied
Added complete YAML front-matter block with title, description, category="cookbook", version="1.0.0", and last_updated="2025-07-09" to recipe documentation.

## üîó Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - all created files contain proper @doc refs annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Added @doc refs docs/architecture-spec.md#monitor-agent annotations to all interface and implementation files

## üèÅ Final Status

**Status**: VALIDATION_PASSED
**Global event counter (g):** 123

## üåç Impact & Next Steps

TDD Refactor phase complete - monitor agent now uses service-oriented architecture with pluggable components. Future extensions (Slack, email, additional metrics sources) can be added without modifying core service logic. Comprehensive cookbook documentation enables pattern reuse across other agents.

## üöÄ Next Steps Preparation

- Monitor agent epic fully complete with all 3 tasks (TEST_CREATION, IMPLEMENTATION, REFACTORING) validated
- Architecture patterns documented for future agent development
- Pluggable components ready for future extensions (Slack, email alerts)
- Integration ready with existing GitHub Actions workflow
- Ready for production deployment as part of V1 feature set
