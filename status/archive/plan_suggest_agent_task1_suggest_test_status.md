## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/architecture-spec.md, docs/engineering-spec.md

**Parent Plan Task**: `suggest_test` from plan_suggest_agent.txt

**Testing Tools**: Jest, supertest, @testing-library/react, nock, sinon

**Cookbook Patterns**: docs/cookbook/recipe_overpass_fetch.md (for schema patterns)

## 🎯 Objective

Create comprehensive failing tests for the suggest-agent API endpoint that validate user submission schema and implement duplicate detection logic for toilet suggestions.

## 📝 Context

This task initiates the TDD Red phase for the suggest-agent, which will handle user-submitted toilet locations and validate them against the existing dataset. The suggest-agent must validate submission schema, detect duplicates, and stage valid submissions for review. This is critical for maintaining data quality and preventing spam submissions.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create test file `tests/agents/suggest_agent_test.js` with failing tests
2. Test API endpoint `/api/suggest` for POST submissions  
3. Test schema validation for required fields (lat, lng, name, etc.)
4. Test duplicate detection against existing toilets.geojson
5. Test submission logging to suggestions.log
6. Test error responses (400, 409, 500)
7. Test rate limiting and validation edge cases
8. Verify all tests fail (Red phase validation)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- API testing patterns with supertest for Next.js API routes
- Schema validation testing with invalid/missing data scenarios
- Duplicate detection algorithms and distance-based matching
- File-based logging patterns for suggestion staging
- Rate limiting implementation for public API endpoints
- Error handling and HTTP status code conventions

## 🛠 Actions Taken

1. **Created TypeScript Interfaces** (`src/types/suggestions.ts`)
   - Comprehensive type definitions for user submissions
   - Validation result structures and error handling
   - API response formats and logging schemas
   - Rate limiting and configuration interfaces

2. **Implemented Comprehensive Test Suite** (`tests/agents/suggest_agent_test.js`)
   - 22 test cases covering all API functionality
   - API endpoint testing with supertest integration
   - Schema validation for coordinates, field types, and data integrity
   - Duplicate detection with distance calculations
   - Submission logging with structured log entries
   - Rate limiting scenarios with IP-based restrictions
   - Error handling for malformed requests and server errors
   - Response format consistency validation

3. **Installed Testing Dependencies**
   - Added supertest for API endpoint testing
   - Integrated with existing Jest testing framework

4. **Created Mock Data Infrastructure**
   - Mock toilets.geojson for duplicate detection testing
   - Test file cleanup and isolation between tests
   - IP address simulation for rate limiting tests

5. **Verified Red Phase (All Tests Failing)**
   - Confirmed all 21 functional tests fail with 404 errors
   - 1 placeholder test passes (server error handling)
   - Proper TDD Red phase validation complete

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/agents/suggest_agent_test.js` | test | created - 22 test cases covering API, validation, duplicate detection |
| `src/types/suggestions.ts` | code | created - comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types |
| `package.json` | config | updated - added supertest dependency |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: No task dependencies (can start immediately)
**External Dependencies Available**: Jest, supertest, Node.js 20.x LTS, TypeScript 5.4.x

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: ✅ Exceeded expectations - created more comprehensive test coverage than originally planned

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** ✅ Schema validation deterministic assumption confirmed - all validation logic testable
**Details:** 
- All 21 functional tests fail with expected 404 errors (Red phase confirmed)
- 1 placeholder test passes as expected
- Test suite covers: API endpoints, schema validation, duplicate detection, logging, rate limiting, error handling
- Mock infrastructure properly isolates tests and simulates production scenarios

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
**Canonical Documentation**: All source files contain proper `@doc refs` annotations pointing to docs/architecture-spec.md#suggest-agent

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 6

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

This Red phase establishes the testing foundation for the suggest-agent API that will enable user-contributed toilet location data. The failing tests define the exact behavior expected from the implementation, ensuring the suggest-agent integrates properly with the existing ingest-agent data pipeline.

**Immediate Follow-ups**:
- Task 2 (suggest_impl) can begin once tests are failing
- Schema interfaces created here will be reused in implementation
- API endpoint patterns established for future agents

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

**For Task 2 (suggest_impl)**:
- Review failing test requirements for exact API behavior
- Plan Next.js API route structure (`src/app/api/suggest/route.ts`)
- Design suggestion logging mechanism (suggestions.log format)
- Consider validation library choice (zod, joi, or ajv)
- Plan duplicate detection algorithm (distance-based matching)

**Technical Considerations**:
- Leverage existing GeoJSON types from ingest-agent
- Consider rate limiting strategy for public endpoint
- Plan error handling and user feedback patterns
- Design staging workflow for manual review process
