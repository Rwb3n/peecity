## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/architecture-spec.md#seo-agent, docs/design-spec.md, docs/engineering.md

**Parent Plan Task**: `seo_refactor` from plan_seo_agent.txt

**Testing Tools**: Jest, jsdom, TypeScript compiler

**Cookbook Patterns**: docs/cookbook/recipe_template_refactoring.md (created during this task)

## 🎯 Objective

Refactor SEO agent template system to improve maintainability, modularity, and extensibility (TDD Refactor phase).

## 📝 Context

This is the REFACTORING task in the TDD cycle, improving code structure while maintaining all functionality. The original 200+ line template generation method mixed multiple concerns and was difficult to maintain and test.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Analyzed code structure and identified refactoring opportunities
2. Extracted specialized template builder classes following SOLID principles
3. Created modular template system with clear separation of concerns
4. Added configuration methods for template customization
5. Validated all tests continue to pass
6. Created cookbook recipe to capture pattern for reuse

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Template Method pattern excellent for complex template generation
- Builder pattern enables modular, testable template components
- SOLID principles significantly improve code maintainability
- Configuration injection allows flexible template customization
- Refactoring should maintain identical output while improving structure
- Documentation of patterns via cookbook recipes ensures knowledge transfer

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Extracted 5 specialized template builder classes:
  - `MetadataTemplateBuilder`: Next.js metadata generation
  - `StructuredDataTemplateBuilder`: JSON-LD structured data
  - `ToiletListTemplateBuilder`: Content formatting with utility methods
  - `BreadcrumbTemplateBuilder`: Navigation component generation
  - `ContentSectionTemplateBuilder`: Header/footer sections
- Created orchestrating `BoroughPageTemplateBuilder` class
- Added `TemplateConfig` interface for configuration
- Implemented `updateTemplateConfig()` and `getTemplateConfig()` methods
- Reduced main template method from 200+ lines to single line delegation
- Created comprehensive cookbook recipe documenting the pattern

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `agents/seo-agent.ts` | code | Refactored with modular template system |
| `docs/cookbook/recipe_template_refactoring.md` | doc | New pattern documentation |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - seo_impl task completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: Yes - TypeScript, Node.js built-in modules

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: Medium
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task exceeded expectations. Template engine selection evolved significantly beyond initial scope, creating a robust, extensible system.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** Template engine selection did evolve as predicted in confidence justification, confirming Medium confidence was appropriate
**Details:** All 13 tests pass successfully. Template output identical to pre-refactor. Code structure significantly improved with better separation of concerns and maintainability.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - refactored implementation maintains proper artifact annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - includes @doc refs to docs/architecture-spec.md#seo-agent

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 15 (incremented from 14 in aiconfig.json)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Significantly improved SEO agent maintainability and extensibility. Template system now follows SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns. Pattern documented in cookbook for reuse across project. Ready for next epic implementation.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- Template builders can be extracted to shared utilities for other agents
- Configuration system could be extended for more customization options
- Pattern applies to other complex template generation across the project
- Consider template caching for performance optimization in future iterations
