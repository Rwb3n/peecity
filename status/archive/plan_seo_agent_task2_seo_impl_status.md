# Status Report: plan_seo_agent_task2_seo_impl_status

**Plan**: `plans/plan_seo_agent.txt`
**Task**: `seo_impl`
**Type**: IMPLEMENTATION
**TDD Phase**: Green
**Status**: DONE
**Date**: 2025-07-04T22:22:37.543Z

---

## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: docs/architecture-spec.md#seo-agent, docs/design-spec.md, docs/engineering.md

**Parent Plan Task**: `seo_impl` from plan_seo_agent.txt

**Testing Tools**: Jest, jsdom, fs (Node.js filesystem), path (Node.js path)

**Cookbook Patterns**: Following patterns from ingest-agent implementation and established TDD practices

## 🎯 Objective

Implement SEO agent script to generate static borough pages with metadata, structured data, and SEO compliance (TDD Green phase).

## 📝 Context

This is the IMPLEMENTATION task in the TDD cycle, creating the actual SEO agent functionality to make all previously failing tests pass. The agent generates Next.js pages for each borough, complete with SEO metadata, structured data (JSON-LD), sitemap.xml, and robots.txt.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Analyzed task dependencies and confirmed seo_test completion
2. Created seo-agent.json manifest with proper configuration
3. Implemented comprehensive seo-agent.ts script with full functionality
4. Fixed minor test incompatibility (capitalization)
5. Validated all tests pass (GREEN phase achieved)
6. Updated status report and project tracking

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

- Borough page generation requires proper coordinate-based or property-based borough detection
- Next.js page components need both metadata export and default component export
- Structured data (JSON-LD) significantly improves SEO for local business listings
- Sitemap and robots.txt generation critical for search engine crawling
- File generation with proper directory creation ensures deployment compatibility
- TypeScript interfaces improve code maintainability and type safety

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created `agents/seo-agent.json` manifest with proper configuration
- Implemented `agents/seo-agent.ts` with comprehensive functionality:
  - ToiletFeature and ToiletCollection interfaces
  - Borough detection and grouping logic
  - Next.js page component generation
  - SEO metadata and structured data generation
  - Sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation
  - Error handling for missing/invalid data
- Fixed capitalization issue in fee text generation
- Restored corrupted toilet test data
- Validated all 13 tests pass successfully

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `agents/seo-agent.json` | config | Agent manifest with configuration |
| `agents/seo-agent.ts` | code | Complete SEO agent implementation |
| `data/toilets.geojson` | data | Restored proper test data |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - seo_test task completed successfully
**External Dependencies Available**: Yes - Node.js built-in modules (fs, path), TypeScript support

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task proceeded exactly as predicted. File generation was deterministic and straightforward as expected.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All assumptions from plan remain valid - file generation is deterministic and SEO requirements well-defined
**Details:** All 13 tests pass successfully. Borough pages generated correctly with proper metadata, structured data, sitemap, and robots.txt. Error handling works for missing/invalid data scenarios.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Verified - all implementation files contain proper artifact annotations
**Canonical Documentation**: Confirmed - implementation includes @doc refs to docs/architecture-spec.md#seo-agent

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 14 (incremented from 13 in aiconfig.json)

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Successfully implemented complete SEO agent functionality. Borough pages can now be generated from toilet data with full SEO compliance. Next task (seo_refactor) can now optimize the template system.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

- Template system could be extracted for better maintainability
- Borough detection algorithm could be enhanced with proper GIS
- Page styling integration with project's design system
- Integration with Next.js build process for automatic generation
