    "self_critique": "This plan is narrowly focused on creating a diagnostic artifact, which is the correct procedure. It rightly avoids any attempt to fix the production code. The success of this plan is entirely dependent on the accurate replication of the failing tests. A potential failure would be if the isolated tests pass, which would invalidate our primary hypothesis and point towards a more complex issue (e.g., test cross-contamination), but this is unlikely given the nature of the errors."
