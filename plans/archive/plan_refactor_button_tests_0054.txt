    "title": "Refactor Brittle MarkerPopup Test Selectors",
    "description": "Based on the builder agent's report, this plan fixes the brittle tests for the MarkerPopup component. It unifies the selectors for the 'Report' button to use the full, explicit `aria-label`, which is the correct source for the accessible name and removes ambiguity.",

In both tests that reference the report button (`should render action buttons` and `should be keyboard navigable`), change the query to use the full and explicit aria-label. The new selector should be `{ name: 'Report an issue with this toilet' }`. This removes the brittle regex and aligns the test with ARIA standards.",

                "The `getByRole` query for the report button must be updated in two places in the diagnostic test file.",
