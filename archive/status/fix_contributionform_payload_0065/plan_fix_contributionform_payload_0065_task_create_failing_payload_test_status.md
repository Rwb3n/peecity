**Type**: TEST_CREATION

## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/engineering-spec.md`, `docs/architecture-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `create_failing_payload_test` from `plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`

**Testing Tools**: Jest, @testing-library/react, userEvent

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/cookbook/recipe_robust_react_testing.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Add a failing test for feature fields in API payload to establish TDD Red phase. Test should verify that changing_table and payment_contactless are included when checkboxes are selected.

## 📝 Context

Part of TDD cycle to fix bug where ContributionForm collects feature data but doesn't send it to the API. Tests were already created during previous debugging session.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Identify existing failing tests in ContributionForm test suite
2. Verify tests check for feature fields in API payload
3. Confirm tests fail for the right reason (missing implementation)
4. Document test expectations

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Existing Failing Tests Found**:
1. `should include feature flags in the API payload when selected` - Tests that changing_table and payment_contactless are in payload
2. `should have correct keyboard navigation focus order including all features` - Tests tab order including feature checkboxes

**Test Pattern Used**:
- Uses jest.spyOn on global.fetch
- Checks stringContaining for feature fields in body
- Tests user interactions with checkboxes before submission

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Analyzed test output from task 1 showing 2 failing tests
- Examined test implementation in ContributionForm_test.tsx
- Confirmed tests are properly structured and fail for correct reason
- Tests already follow project testing patterns

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/components/molecules/ContributionForm_test.tsx` | test | Already contains failing tests |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - verify_baseline completed
**External Dependencies Available**: Jest, @testing-library/react confirmed working

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Tests already existed from debugging session. Task essentially pre-completed.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** Gate 1 criteria met - failing tests don't break existing tests
**Details:** Test output shows 26 passing, 2 failing. The 2 failing tests are exactly what we need for TDD Red phase.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Tests already have proper file headers
**Canonical Documentation**: Test references docs/frontend-ui-spec.md

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 171

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

TDD Red phase established. We have failing tests that specify the expected behavior. The tests fail because the implementation is missing, not because of test errors.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

✅ Failing tests in place checking for changing_table and payment_contactless
✅ Tests use proper mocking pattern (jest.spyOn)
✅ 26 existing tests still passing (gate 1 satisfied)
→ Ready for Task 3: Implement minimal fix to make tests pass
