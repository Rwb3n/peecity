## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/engineering-spec.md`, `docs/architecture-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `add_comprehensive_feature_tests` from `plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`

**Testing Tools**: Jest, @testing-library/react, userEvent

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/cookbook/recipe_robust_react_testing.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Add comprehensive test coverage for feature field handling: test with no features, single features, and document behavior for radar/automatic fields.

## 📝 Context

After implementing the fix, we need additional tests to ensure robustness and prevent regressions. These tests will cover edge cases and document expected behavior.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Add test for submission with no features selected (should not include feature fields)
2. Add test for submission with only one feature selected
3. Add test documenting radar and automatic field behavior
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Confirm comprehensive coverage achieved

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Test Patterns Used**:
- Negative testing with `expect.not.stringContaining()` to verify fields are NOT included
- Direct JSON parsing of request body for precise assertions
- Clear test names that document expected behavior
- Comments explaining why certain fields are not mapped (v1 API limitations)

**Edge Cases Covered**:
1. No features selected → no feature fields in payload
2. Single feature selected → only that feature field included
3. All features selected → only v1-supported fields included (radar/automatic excluded)

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Added test for no features selected scenario
- Added test for single feature (baby changing only) scenario
- Added test documenting v1 API limitations (radar/automatic not mapped)
- Used direct JSON parsing for more precise payload verification
- All tests passing (31 total tests)

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `tests/components/molecules/ContributionForm_test.tsx` | test | Added 3 comprehensive feature tests |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - implement_minimal_payload_fix completed
**External Dependencies Available**: Jest, React Testing Library

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task completed exactly as planned. Added 3 comprehensive tests covering all specified scenarios.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** All assumptions valid - tests document current v1 API behavior
**Details:** All 31 tests passing. New tests verify edge cases and document v1 limitations.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Test file already has proper headers
**Canonical Documentation**: Tests serve as behavior documentation

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 173

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Comprehensive test coverage achieved. Edge cases documented. Clear separation between v1 supported features (baby changing, contactless) and unsupported features (radar, automatic). Tests will prevent regressions during future refactoring.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

✅ All feature scenarios tested
✅ v1 API limitations documented in tests
✅ Ready for refactoring phase
