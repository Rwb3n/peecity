## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/architecture-spec.md`, `docs/engineering-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `implement_minimal_payload_fix` from `plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`

**Testing Tools**: Jest

**Cookbook Patterns**: N/A - minimal implementation change

## 🎯 Objective

Add minimal code to handleFormSubmit function to include feature fields (changing_table, payment_contactless) in API payload when checkboxes are selected.

## 📝 Context

TDD Green phase - make the failing tests pass with minimal implementation. Must maintain all 26 existing tests passing while fixing the 2 feature tests.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Locate handleFormSubmit function in ContributionForm.tsx
2. Find line 193 (after fee assignment)
3. Add feature field mappings for babyChange → changing_table and contactless → payment_contactless
4. Run tests to verify all 28 tests pass
5. Confirm gate 2 criteria met

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Used optional chaining (`?.`) for safe property access
- Added feature mappings directly after core fields
- Minimal change approach - only added necessary lines
- TypeScript automatically handled the dynamic property assignment

**Test Fixes Required**:
- Had to update test to use correct label text ("Baby Changing Facilities" not "baby change")
- Fixed missing fetch mock in feature test
- Fixed missing variable declarations in keyboard navigation test

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Located handleFormSubmit function in ContributionForm.tsx
- Added feature field mappings after line 193 (fee assignment)
- Fixed test label to match actual UI text
- Added proper fetch mock to feature test
- Fixed keyboard navigation test with proper setup
- Verified all 28 tests pass (26 original + 2 feature tests)

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `src/components/molecules/ContributionForm/ContributionForm.tsx` | code | Added feature field mappings |
| `tests/components/molecules/ContributionForm_test.tsx` | test | Fixed test issues |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - create_failing_payload_test completed
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js, TypeScript, React

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Implementation succeeded as planned. Had to fix test issues that weren't anticipated but core implementation was exactly as specified.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** Gate 2 criteria met - all 28 tests passing (26 original + 2 feature)
**Details:** Test suite shows: "Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total. Tests: 28 passed, 28 total"

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Component already has proper file header comments
**Canonical Documentation**: Existing @fileoverview references maintained

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 172

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Feature data is now successfully included in API payload. Users can submit toilet suggestions with baby changing and contactless payment features. Bug fixed with minimal change and zero regression.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

✅ Implementation complete with minimal changes
✅ All tests passing (gate 2 satisfied)
✅ Ready for additional test coverage
