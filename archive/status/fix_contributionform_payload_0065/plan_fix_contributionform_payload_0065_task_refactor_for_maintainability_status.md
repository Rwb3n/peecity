## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/architecture-spec.md`, `docs/engineering-spec.md`, CLAUDE.md (SOLID principles)

**Parent Plan Task**: `refactor_for_maintainability` from `plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`

**Testing Tools**: Jest

**Cookbook Patterns**: Service-oriented architecture, SOLID principles

## 🎯 Objective

Extract feature mapping logic into a pure helper function following SOLID principles, specifically Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), to improve maintainability and prepare for v2 migration.

## 📝 Context

TDD Refactor phase - improve code organization without changing behavior. The project follows SOLID principles and service-oriented architecture. This refactoring will separate concerns and make the v2 migration easier.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create `mapFeaturesToApi` helper function with proper TypeScript typing
2. Extract feature mapping logic from handleFormSubmit
3. Use Object.assign to merge mapped features into requestBody
4. Run all tests to ensure no behavior changes
5. Verify gate 3 criteria (no external API changes)

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Project Best Practices to Follow**:
- SOLID Compliance - Single Responsibility Principle for the helper
- Pure functions for easy testing
- Proper TypeScript typing for type safety
- Keep functions focused and composable
- Document the mapping logic for future developers

**TypeScript Considerations**:
- Features type from Zod schema: `{ babyChange: boolean, radar: boolean, automatic: boolean, contactless: boolean }`
- Return type should be explicit: `Record<string, boolean>`
- Helper should handle undefined/null features gracefully
- Consider making it extensible for v2 migration

**Critical Analysis - Extensibility for v2**:
- Current design allows easy addition of v2 mappings (e.g., add v2 parameter)
- Could extend to: `mapFeaturesToApi(features?: Features, apiVersion: 'v1' | 'v2' = 'v1')`
- Return type is flexible enough for v2's different value types
- Function is isolated, making it easy to test v2 mappings independently

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Created Features type using z.infer for type safety
- Implemented mapFeaturesToApi pure helper function with JSDoc documentation
- Added explicit return type Record<string, boolean>
- Handled undefined/null features gracefully
- Replaced inline if statements with Object.assign pattern
- Verified all 31 tests still pass
- Documented v1 API limitations in function comments

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `src/components/molecules/ContributionForm/ContributionForm.tsx` | code | Added helper function, refactored mapping logic |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - add_comprehensive_feature_tests completed
**External Dependencies Available**: TypeScript, React

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: Medium
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Refactoring completed exactly as planned. Helper function is pure, testable, and follows SOLID principles.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** Gate 3 criteria met - no external API changes, all tests pass
**Details:** All 31 tests passing. Refactoring maintains exact same behavior with improved code organization.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Component already has proper @fileoverview annotation
**Canonical Documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc to helper function

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 174

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Successfully separated concerns following SOLID principles. The mapFeaturesToApi helper is:
- Pure function (no side effects)
- Single responsibility (only maps features)
- Open for extension (easy to add v2 mappings)
- Well-documented for future developers
- Type-safe with explicit types

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

✅ Helper function ready for v2 extension
✅ Clear separation of mapping logic
✅ All tests passing (gate 3 satisfied)
→ Next: Task 6 - Document v2 migration plan with feature flag approach
