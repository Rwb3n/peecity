# Status Report: plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065_task_verify_baseline_status

**Plan**: `plans/plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`
**Task**: `verify_baseline`
**Type**: VERIFICATION
**TDD Phase**: 
**Status**: PENDING
**Date**: 2025-07-12T11:33:53.587Z

## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/architecture-spec.md`, `docs/engineering-spec.md`

**Parent Plan Task**: `verify_baseline` from `plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`

**Testing Tools**: Jest, @testing-library/react

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/cookbook/recipe_robust_react_testing.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Run the full ContributionForm test suite to confirm all 26 tests are passing, document the current payload structure, and create a new git branch for isolation.

## 📝 Context

This is the safety pre-condition step for fixing a critical bug where ContributionForm collects feature data but fails to include it in the API payload. We must establish a known-good baseline before making any changes.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Run ContributionForm test suite to verify all 26 tests pass
2. Capture and document current API payload structure
3. Create new git branch 'fix/contribution-form-payload'
4. Update status report with findings

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Current API Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "name": "API Test Toilet",
  "lat": 51.5074,
  "lng": -0.1278,
  "hours": "24/7",
  "accessible": true,
  "fee": 0
}
```

**Missing Feature Fields**:
- `changing_table` - should be included when baby change checkbox is selected
- `payment_contactless` - should be included when contactless payment checkbox is selected

**Test Suite Status**:
- 26 tests passing (core functionality working)
- 2 tests failing (feature flag tests already added during debugging)
- This confirms the bug: feature data is collected but not sent to API

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Ran ContributionForm test suite using jest directly
- Found 26 passing tests + 2 failing tests (pre-existing from debugging)
- Documented current API payload structure from test
- Created new git branch 'fix/contribution-form-payload'

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| git branch | version control | created fix/contribution-form-payload |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - No dependencies (first task in plan)
**External Dependencies Available**: Node.js 20.x, Jest, React Testing Library

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Task proceeded as expected. Found existing feature tests already added, confirming the bug.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** Critical assumptions validated - core functionality working (26 tests passing)
**Details:** Test suite confirmed the bug exists. Feature checkboxes are rendered but their values are not included in the API payload. Safe to proceed with fix.

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: N/A - No code files modified
**Canonical Documentation**: N/A - Verification task only

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 170

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Successfully established baseline for safe fix implementation. Core functionality confirmed working with 26 passing tests. Bug confirmed with 2 failing feature tests. Safe to proceed with TDD cycle.

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

✅ Git branch created and ready
✅ Test suite baseline documented  
✅ Current payload structure captured
✅ Missing fields identified (changing_table, payment_contactless)
→ Next: Task 2 - Since failing tests already exist, skip to Task 3 (implement_minimal_payload_fix)
