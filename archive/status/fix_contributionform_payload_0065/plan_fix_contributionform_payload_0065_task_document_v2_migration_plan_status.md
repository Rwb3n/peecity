## 📚 Appropriate References

**Documentation**: `docs/reference/api/suggest-api.md`, CLAUDE.md (v2 Schema section)

**Parent Plan Task**: `document_v2_migration_plan` from `plan_fix_contributionform_payload_0065.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A - Planning task

**Cookbook Patterns**: `templates/template_safe_migration_plan.json`, `docs/cookbook/recipe_safe_migration_patterns.md`

## 🎯 Objective

Document the v2 migration plan complexities including 8 core fields requirement, boolean to string conversions, property name changes, and feature flag approach for safe rollout.

## 📝 Context

The v2 migration plan (0066) already exists but needs to be reviewed and potentially enhanced based on our learnings from the payload fix. This task ensures the plan is comprehensive and follows the safe migration template.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Review existing plan_contributionform_v2_migration_0066.txt
2. Verify it covers all v2 API requirements from suggest-api.md
3. Ensure feature flag approach is clearly documented
4. Validate against template_safe_migration_plan.json
5. Document any additional insights from the payload fix work

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Key v2 Migration Complexities**:
- v2 requires 8 core fields (@id, amenity, wheelchair, access, opening_hours, fee, lat, lng)
- Boolean to string conversions ('yes'/'no' instead of true/false)
- Property name changes (payment_contactless → payment:contactless)
- Fee type change (number in v1 → boolean in v2)
- Need for payload transformation service layer

**Lessons from Payload Fix Implementation**:
- Helper function (mapFeaturesToApi) is already extensible for v2
- Test coverage is comprehensive (31 tests) providing safety net
- Clear separation of concerns makes v2 addition easier
- Feature flag approach critical for safe production rollout
- Consider dual-endpoint support during transition period

## 🛠 Actions Taken

- Reviewed existing plan_contributionform_v2_migration_0066.txt
- Identified that plan lacks explicit safety gates from our template
- Analyzed v1 vs v2 API differences and transformation requirements
- Created safety gates addendum based on successful payload fix patterns
- Documented how mapFeaturesToApi helper can be extended for v2
- Added specific gate criteria for each migration phase
- Incorporated lessons learned from TDD approach

## 📦 Artifacts Produced / Modified
| Path | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `docs/addendum_v2_migration_safety_gates.md` | doc | Created comprehensive safety gates documentation |
| `plans/plan_contributionform_v2_migration_0066.txt` | plan | Reviewed and validated existing plan |

## 🔗 Dependencies Validation

**Task Dependencies Met**: Yes - refactor_for_maintainability completed
**External Dependencies Available**: Documentation and templates available

## 📋 Confidence Assessment

**Original Confidence Level**: High
**Actual Outcome vs Expected**: Plan 0066 exists and is comprehensive. Enhanced it with safety gates based on our successful patterns.

## ✅ Validation

**Result:** VALIDATION_PASSED
**Assumptions Check:** v2 migration complexity confirmed - significant API differences require careful approach
**Details:** Created addendum documenting 5 safety gates, risk mitigations, and extensibility patterns for helper function

## 🔗 Artifact Annotations Compliance

**Annotation Status**: Added proper frontmatter to addendum document
**Canonical Documentation**: Referenced related plans and linked to successful patterns

## 🏁 Final Status

**Status**: DONE
**Global event counter (g):** 175

## 🌍 Impact & Next Steps

Successfully documented comprehensive v2 migration approach with safety gates. The migration plan now has:
- Clear gate criteria at each phase
- Proven patterns from payload fix success
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Measurable success criteria
- Rollback procedures

## 🚀 Next Steps Preparation

✅ v2 migration plan validated and enhanced
✅ Safety gates documented for each phase
✅ Helper function extensibility documented
→ Ready for v2 migration implementation when prioritized
→ Payload fix (plan 0065) is now COMPLETE
