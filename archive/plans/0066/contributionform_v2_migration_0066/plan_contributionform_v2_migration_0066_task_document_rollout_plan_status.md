**Parent Plan Task**: `document_rollout_plan` from `plan_contributionform_v2_migration_0066.txt`

**Testing Tools**: N/A (Documentation task)

**Cookbook Patterns**: `docs/runbooks/` directory for runbook template patterns

## 🎯 Objective

Create comprehensive documentation for the v2 API migration rollout, including phased deployment plan, success metrics, monitoring queries, rollback procedures, and timeline with checkpoints.

## 📝 Context

This is the final task in our safety-first migration plan. With all technical implementation complete (transformer, feature flag, tests, monitoring), we need operational documentation to guide the production rollout safely and systematically.

## 🪜 Task Steps Summary

1. Create `docs/runbooks/contributionform-v2-rollout.md` with proper frontmatter
2. Document phased rollout stages (dev → staging → canary → production)
3. Define success metrics and monitoring queries
4. Detail rollback procedures with specific steps
5. Create timeline with go/no-go checkpoints
6. Include SQL/log queries for analyzing submission patterns
7. Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture

**Rollout Documentation Structure**:
- Follow existing runbook format with frontmatter
- Include severity levels and business impact
- Provide concrete queries and commands
- Make it actionable for on-call engineers

**Key Content Areas**:
1. **Phased Rollout**: Gradual increase in v2 traffic
2. **Success Metrics**: Error rates, validation failures, performance
3. **Monitoring Queries**: Log searches, metrics queries
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Environment variable changes, deployment rollback
5. **Timeline**: Specific dates and checkpoints
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

**Safety Gates Summary** (from completed tasks):
- Gate 1: ✅ Transformer service (Task 1)
- Gate 2: ✅ Feature flag (Task 2)
- Gate 3: ✅ v2 tests (Task 4)
- Gate 4: ✅ Dual endpoints (Task 5)
- Gate 5: ✅ Monitoring (Task 6)

## 🛠 Actions Taken

1. **Created comprehensive runbook** at `docs/runbooks/contributionform-v2-rollout.md`
   - Used established frontmatter format
   - Followed existing runbook patterns

2. **Documented 5-phase rollout plan**:
   - Phase 1: Development (immediate)
   - Phase 2: Staging (week 1)
   - Phase 3: Canary 10% (week 2)
   - Phase 4: Production 50% (week 3)
   - Phase 5: Full production (week 4)

3. **Included monitoring queries**:
   - SQL queries for API version distribution
   - Log analysis commands with jq
   - Prometheus metrics queries
   - Real-time monitoring scripts

4. **Detailed rollback procedures**:
   - Immediate rollback via env var (< 5 min)
   - Feature flag rollback (< 30 min)
   - Code rollback process (< 1 hour)

5. **Added troubleshooting guide**:
   - Common issues with solutions
   - Investigation commands
   - Escalation path

6. **Provided operational tools**:
   - Success criteria checklist
   - Post-migration cleanup tasks
   - Useful command snippets
