  "title": "Duplicate detection test failing - 50m proximity check returns 201 instead of 409",
  "description": "The suggest agent duplicate detection test 'should flag near-duplicate within 50m' is failing. Expected HTTP 409 (duplicate found) but receiving 201 (success). This indicates the duplicate detection algorithm is not properly identifying toilets within the 50-meter threshold.\n\nTest failure details:\n- File: tests/agents/suggest_agent_duplicates_test.js\n- Expected status: 409\n- Actual status: 201\n- This suggests duplicate detection logic in DuplicateService or related utilities may not be working correctly\n\nThis is isolated from the ingest refactor test infrastructure fixes and represents a separate business logic issue.",
