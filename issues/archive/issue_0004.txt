  "title": "Ingest service/CLI fails live OSM API calls despite connectivity",
  "description": "When running the ingest CLI (scripts/ingest-cli.ts) or invoking IngestService directly, the process aborts with an error even though the Overpass API endpoint is reachable via curl/browser. Sample data ingestion using local fixtures works, indicating the failure is confined to live network calls.",
  "file": "scripts/ingest-cli.ts",
  "line": 0,
  "impact": "Live data ingestion is blocked, preventing up-to-date dataset generation and downstream SEO agent page builds.",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "Set OVERPASS_API_URL to https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter (or leave default)",
    "Run: npm run ingest (or node scripts/ingest-cli.ts run)",
    "Observe error stack trace indicating request failure despite HTTP 200 when tested externally"
  ],
  "expected_behavior": "IngestService should fetch data from the Overpass API and produce toilets.geojson without throwing an error when the endpoint is reachable and returns 200.",
  "current_behavior": "CLI exits with failure; IngestService throws network-related error.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "User-agent header missing or blocked by API.",
    "TLS/HTTPS agent misconfiguration in native HTTP helper.",
    "Request payload malformed, causing Overpass to return HTTP 400/429 which IngestService interprets as failure."
