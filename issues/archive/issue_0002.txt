  "title": "Jest configuration missing prevents test execution",
  "description": "During validation of task_0001, Jest failed to find any configuration file (jest.config.js|ts|mjs|json). This halted the test run before reaching assertions, violating the TDD workflow.",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "Run `npx jest tests/config/aiconfig_schema_test.js`",
    "Observe error: Could not find a config file based on provided values."
  ],
  "expected_behavior": "Jest should execute the newly created test and fail due to missing aiconfig.json, not due to missing Jest config.",
  "proposed_resolution": "Add minimal jest.config.js exporting `{ testEnvironment: 'node' }` at project root, or include full Jest configuration details in aiconfig.json and mirrored config file.",
  "related_task": "plan_0001 task_0001",
  "created_at": "2025-07-04T00:10:00Z",
  "status": "RESOLVED",
  "resolution": "Added jest.config.js and updated aiconfig.json; tests pass."
