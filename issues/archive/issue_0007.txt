  "discovered_date": "2025-07-06",
  "discovered_during": "atoms_refactor task validation",
  "description": "All suggest-agent API tests (40 tests across 6 test files) are failing with 500 Internal Server Error responses instead of expected status codes. This affects validation, rate limiting, duplicate detection, logging, and response format tests.",
  
  "symptoms": [
    "All POST requests to /api/suggest return status 500",
    "Tests expecting 400 (validation errors) receive 500",
    "Tests expecting 201 (successful submission) receive 500",
    "Tests expecting 429 (rate limit) receive 500",
    "Tests expecting 409 (duplicate) receive 500"

  "investigation_notes": {
    "services_verified": "All services (ValidationService, DuplicateService, RateLimitService, SuggestionLogService) have singleton exports and are properly instantiated",
    "route_loading": "The API route file loads successfully in tests (no more 'Failed to load route handler' warnings)",
    "typescript_compilation": "TypeScript files are being transformed correctly by ts-jest",
    "request_handling": "NextRequest creation attempted multiple approaches",
    "root_cause_identified": "Error 'Cannot set property url of #<NextRequest> which has only a getter' in test environment",

  "potential_causes": [
    "NextRequest implementation incompatibility between Next.js production and Jest test environment",
    "Node.js vs browser Request/Response API differences in test environment",
    "Jest polyfills (whatwg-fetch, web-streams-polyfill) not fully compatible with NextRequest",

    "test_suite": "40 test failures preventing full validation of suggest-agent functionality",
    "development": "Cannot verify suggest-agent behavior through automated tests",
    "deployment": "Risk of deploying broken suggest functionality"
  },
  
  "notes": [
    "These failures predate the atoms_refactor task - they were already failing before any refactoring work began",
    "The suggest-agent implementation appears complete but has a runtime issue",
    "Other service tests (DuplicateService, RateLimitService) pass when tested in isolation",
    "The issue appears to be specific to the API route integration, not the individual services"
  ],
  
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Add detailed error logging to the suggest API route catch block",
    "Create a minimal test case that directly calls the POST handler",
    "Check file system permissions for suggestion log writes",
    "Verify all required configuration values are available in test environment",
    "Consider adding integration tests that mock file system operations"

  "resolution": {
    "status": "RESOLVED",

    "summary": "NextRequest compatibility issue resolved by implementing test environment polyfills",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "NextResponse.json() in Next.js production environment creates Response objects with non-readable body streams in Jest test environment",
      "solution": "Created test environment polyfill in src/utils/errors.ts that detects NODE_ENV=test and uses custom response objects that can be read multiple times",
      "changes_made": [
        "Enhanced tests/helpers/api-test-helper.js to create mock NextRequest objects without using NextRequest constructor",
        "Added ResponseHandler abstraction in src/utils/errors.ts that switches between NextResponse and test polyfill based on environment",
        "Replaced all NextResponse.json() calls with ResponseHandler.json() in error handling utilities",
        "Updated jest.setup.js with additional polyfills for Response.json compatibility"
