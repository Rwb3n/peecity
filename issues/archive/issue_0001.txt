  "assumptions": [
    "The project should include an aiconfig.json file defining architecture, testing standards, and the global event counter (g).",
    "The absence of this file prevents conformance to mandated workflows (ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, etc.)."

  "clarifying_questions": [
    "Could you provide the aiconfig.json file or confirm its intended location within the repository?",
