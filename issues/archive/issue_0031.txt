  "title": "Monitor-agent Task 1 validation failed: CLI executable flag & Windows path expectations",
  "description": "Re-validation of plan_monitor_agent_0016 Task 1 shows two failing tests. The CLI wrapper lacks executable permission bits on Windows, and configuration path expectations use Unix-style forward slashes causing assertion failure. Core logic passes; fixes are minor but required to meet TDD Green criteria.",
