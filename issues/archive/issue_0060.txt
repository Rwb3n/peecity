  "name": "Unresolvable Critical Test Failure Loop in SearchBar",
  "description": "This issue represents a catastrophic failure of the automated diagnostic and repair process. After three failed attempts (`plan_fix_searchbar_tests_0058`, `plan_fix_searchbar_async_tests_0059`), the `SearchBar` component's test suite (`tests/components/molecules/SearchBar_test.tsx`) remains in a critical failure state. The same 8 tests consistently fail with the same `act()` warnings, indicating a deep, unresolvable race condition that is beyond the system's current capabilities to diagnose. The core problem appears to be an intractable asynchronous issue when testing state updates triggered by user events.",
  "type": "BUG",
  "g": "g_0060",

  "severity": "Critical",
  "reproducibility": "Consistent",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "1. Execute `npm test -- tests/components/molecules/`",
    "2. Observe that the test suite fails with 8 errors in `SearchBar_test.tsx`.",
    "3. Note the recurring `Warning: An update to SearchBar inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)` despite multiple attempts to fix it."
