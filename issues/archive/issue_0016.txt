  "title": "Task 7 validation metrics implementation incomplete - TDD Green phase failed",
  "description": "Task 7 of plan_validation_service_tier_0012 has critical implementation gaps and failing tests. 3/8 performance benchmarks fail intermittently, and several required features were not implemented. This violates the TDD mandate that all tests must pass in the Green phase.",
